For the next several months, and quite possibly several years, to come, I will be researching a thesis on the medieval art of memory, and how it influences medieval interpretations of the biblical text. I hope to be doing biweekly blog posts summarizing my research over the summer months.  They might not be long, but they'll help to keep me focused. Here's (roughly) the summer reading list.  I'll be writing mostly about the primary sources, since I'll be reading that more carefully than the modern scholarship.  Also, I'll be trying to do most of the primary research in the original, rather than in translation. **Primary sources.**

*   _Didascalion, _Hugh of St. Victor
*   _ST II _(selections), _Commentaria _De Memoria_ et Reminiscentia, _St. Thomas
*   _Confessions _(selections), St. Augustine
*   _Consolatio philosophiae, _Boethius
*   _On Memory and Recollection, _Aristotle
*   Various and sundry selections from Plato.

Of course I'll be drawing from various other sources as I go along, especially from the Patristics, but those should be the main works that occupy my time over the next few months. **Contemporary Sources**

*   _When God Spoke Greek, _Timothy Michael Law
*   _The Love of Learning and the Desire for God, _Jean Leclerq
*   _The Medieval Craft of Memory,_ ed. Mary Caruthers\*
*   _The Book of Memory,_ Mary Caruthers
*   _The Craft of Thought_, Mary Caruthers
*   _The Art of Memory, _Frances Yates
*   _Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Literature_ (selections),C.S. Lewis
*   _The Canon of Scripture, _F. F. Bruce
*   _Medieval Music and the Art of Memory, _Anna Maria Busse Berger

\*This is an edited selection of primary sources. No doubt the footnotes will lead to plenty more fun rabbit trails, but this is a beginning for the summer, placed here on the blog as a way to, shall we say, jog my memory later on.
