# Blog Introduction

My intention for this blog is for it to be a reading journal. Perhaps I'll
occasionally write about other things.

Once I had larger aspirations for it, and there are number of articles which I
once write for it, which perhaps I will someday put up in an archive. For now,
they are available amongst the old blog's code at [its Github
repository](https://github.com/michaelhelvey/michaelhelvey.dev)
