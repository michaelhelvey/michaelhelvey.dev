# Aurelius, Books 9-12, Selections

9.1 Again, one who pursues pleasure as good and tries to avoid pain as an evil
is acting irreverently; for it is inevitable that such a person must often find
fault with universal nature for assigning something to good people or bad which
is contrary to their deserts, because it is so often the case that the bad
devote themselves to pleasure and secure the things that give rise to it whilst
the good encounter pain and what gives rise to that.

9.1 (later) … And when I say that universal nature employs these things in a
neutral manner, I mean that, through the natural sequence of cause and effect,
they happen indifferently to all that comes into being and whose existence is
consequent upon a primeval impulse of providence, by which it set out from a
first beginning to create the present order of things, having conceived certain
principles of all that was to be, and assigned powers to generate the necessary
substances and transformations and successions.

9.17 For the stone thrown into the air, it is no bad things to fall down again,
as it was no good thing to rise up.

9.20 The wrongdoing of another should be left with its author.

9.35 Loss is nothing other than change; and change is the delight of universal
nature, according to whose will all things come to pass.

10.2 Observe what your nature requires of you, in so far as you are merely
governed by physical nature, and then do it and accede willingly, if your nature
as a living creature will suffer no impairment. Next you must observe what you
nature as a living creature requires of you, and accept that fully, if your
nature as a rational living creature will suffer no impairment. Now every
rational being is, by virtue of its rationality, also a social being. So apply
these rules, and trouble yourself no further.

10.6 Whether there are merely atoms or a universal nature, let it be postulated
first that I am a part of the whole which is governed by nature, let it be
postulated first that I am a part of the whole which is governed by nature, and
secondly, that I am bound by a tie of kinship to other parts of the same nature
as myself. If I keep those thoughts in mind, I shall never, in so far as I am a
part, be discontented with anything allotted to me from the whole, for nothing
which benefits the whole brings harm to the part. For the whole contains nothing
that is not to its own good, and while this is a characteristic that all natures
share in common, universal nature has this further characteristic, that there is
no cause outside itself which could compel it to generate anything harmful to
itself. If I remember, then, that I am a part of such a whole, I shall be well
contented with all that comes to pas; and in so far as I am bound by a tie of
kinship to other parts of the same nature as myself, I will never act against
the common interest, but rather, I will take proper account of my fellows, and
direct every impulse to the common benefit and turn it away from anything that
runs counter to it. And when this is duly accomplished, my life must necessarily
follow a happy course, just as you would observe that any citizen’s life
proceeds happily on its course when he makes his way through it performing
actions which benefit his fellow-citizens and he welcomes whatever his city
assigns to him.

10.14 To nature who bestows all things and takes them all back, a person of true
culture and modesty will say: ‘Give what it please you to give, and take what it
please you to take’; and say so in no defiant spirit, but as one who only obeys
her designs and thinks nothing but good of her.

10.24 What does my governing faculty mean to me, and what use am I presently
making of it, and to what end am I employing it? Is it devoid of reason? Is it
detached and severed from sociability? Or is it so fused and blended with my
poor flesh as to move at one with it?

10.29 As you engage in each particular action, stop and ask yourself this
question: Is death something terrible because I would be deprived of this?

10.38 Remember that the power that pulls our strings is that which is hidden
within us: that is the source of our action, and our life, and that, if one may
say so, is the person himself. When picturing its nature, never confuse it with
the fleshly vessel that encloses it or these organs molded around us; for these
are mere instruments like an axe, differing only in this, that they are attached
to us as part of ourselves. For in truth, these parts are of no more value
without the cause that set them to work or brings them to rest than the shuttle
to the weaver, or the pen to the writer, or the whip to the charioteer.

11.1 …Rather, in every part of the whole, and wherever its end overtakes it, it
realizes what it has proposed to itself fully and completely, so that it can
say, ‘All that is mine, I have.’ …

11.18 _Summary of the 9 rules for life_

1. Consider how you stand in relation to others, and consider that nature is the
   power that governs the whole, and that lower things (like yourself) exist for
   the sake of the higher.
2. Consider what kind of person others are, above all, in what compulsions they
   are subject to because of their opinions, and what pride they take in their
   acts.
3. If other people are acting rightly, there is no reason for you to be angry or
   perturbed of spirit, but if they are acting wrongly, it is involuntary or
   because of ignorance, so you still should not be angry.
4. Remember that you for your part are just as great a sinner as they.
5. You cannot even be certain that what they are doing is wrong, because knowing
   what is right or wrong for someone else requires an enormous amount of
   context that many times you are not privy to.
6. When you are annoyed beyond measure and losing all patience, remember that
   human life lasts but a moment, and that in a short while we shall all have
   been laid to rest.
7. It is not people’s actions that trouble us, because those are the decisions
   of their governing faculties, but rather the opinions that our governing
   faculties form of their actions. So stop making judgments of others that end
   in only harming yourself. The only actions of which you should be ashamed are
   your own.
8. The anger and distress we feel at other people acting badly give us more
   suffering than the things that the other people did in the first place.
9. Kindness is invincible, if it’s genuine. If you can’t change someone, say
   nothing, but if you have the opportunity to correct someone gently and
   without sarcasm or public reproach, do so.
10. Extra credit! (or in MA’s words, “if you will, accept this tenth gift from
    Apollo”), it’s foolish to expect the bad not to wrong, because that’s to
    wish the impossible. But to expect that they should do wrong to others, but
    to expect them to exempt you, is “senseless and tyrannical.”

12.7 Consider what you should be like in both body and soul when death overtakes
you, and the brevity of life, and the abyss of time that yawns behind it and
before it, and the fragility of everything material.

12.32 … “Imagine nothing to be of any great moment apart from this, that you
should act as your own nature directs, and love what universal nature brings.”

Considerations:

-   In 9.1 MA condemns of those who “avoid pain as an evil.” By describing pain in
    such terms, it rather seems that he is sidestepping the problem of evil by
    saying that pain is not actually evil; it is merely the conflict of one’s will
    with the will of universal nature. By accepting what universal nature has set
    out for us, we can refuse to treat our misfortunes as pain. As helpful as this
    is psychologically in coping with pain, I’m not sure at what point this kind
    of argument, qua ethical argument, is simply callous, or at least so prima
    facie. “The suffering of one who’s parent was killed during the Holocaust is
    not actually real, it is merely them being irreverent by perturbing themselves
    over the assignments of universal nature.” This is not a convincing or helpful
    statement, it seems, at least emotionally. But perhaps such emotions are
    merely the work of the lower appetites? Perhaps I’m overthinking it and MA is
    not trying to make an ethical statement at all, or perhaps he would see such
    ethical concerns, separated from the brute fact of universal nature, as
    useless? He says later (see next quote), that universal nature created “both
    opposites.” There seems to be a strange Manicheanism about all this.
-   In 9.17 we seem to see more of this “nothing is actually good or evil, only
    our relationship to it,” sort of thing. Yet clearly he believes evil to exist,
    because the entire point of his book is to show the reader that acting and
    being well is better than acting selfishly, or cruelly, or in some other evil
    way.
-   In 10.6 I suppose I get my answer to the previous two questions. Marcus
    Aurelius leans into the problem of evil completely and concludes that evil
    doesn’t exist at all — it’s only our relationship to the world. Pain and
    suffering aren’t the result of evil, merely the result of a flawed
    relationship to the “will” (by which MA really just means “what exists”) of
    universal nature. Once we learn to accept that we are a part of a whole which
    by definition can contain nothing that is not to its own good, then by
    definition whatever is is good for me, since I am a part of the whole. At this
    first this seems to be quite an unconvincing argument, but as I think about it
    more, it’s not that different than the classical definition of evil as the
    privation of good. Properly speaking, of course evil doesn’t exist, it’s just
    a relationship to the good (if we define negation as a relationship). It
    doesn’t seem a great philosophical stretch to say that “our evil” (that is to
    say, either evil that we commit, actions against the common good, or evil that
    we receive in the form of pain and suffering) is simply a relationship that we
    have to the good, which is “what is.” Good is, quite literally, “all that is.”
    After all, evil isn’t, so what other choice do we have? As far as Christian
    theology goes, this makes sense so far, but then insert “God” for “universal
    nature” as seems to be appropriate when reading MA and I get quite confused
    again. If evil doesn’t exist, and the “evil” that we either commit or receive
    comes simply through a flawed relationship to nature, why would God bother
    with sending his Son to die? I thought there wasn’t anything to fix? Creation
    isn’t flawed after all, it’s just our perspective in it. Maybe we can bring
    the two together by saying that sin, the corruption of the image of God in us,
    is what gives us the flawed relationship to nature that causes both the
    commission and reception of evil. The “existence” of “evil” in this sense
    isn’t really a flaw in nature but it is a flaw “in us” (somehow? I mean,
    aren’t we parts of nature? So how can we bring pain and suffering on ourselves
    through our delusion, as MA seems to be suggesting?), and that flaw “in us” is
    what Christ solves through his incarnation. Our sin isn’t really “evil” in
    itself (remember! Evil can’t exist by definition!) it’s just “bad for us” and
    so part of good, which is all that is, is God’s decree that Christ redeem us.
    Perhaps the story of redemption is a temporal manifestation of the fact that
    evil can’t actually exist, since God exists outside of time. Ok, I think I’ve
    gone far enough down this speculative road for now.
-   In 10.29 MA asks “Is death something terrible because I would be deprived of
    this?” I feel that really this is at the psychological root of attraction to
    Stoic philosophy. I think some people would answer this question “no.” I am
    not one of those people, and so deeply appreciate Stoicism, without much
    emotional turmoil.
-   I don’t understand 11.21’s argument for attending to the common good at all.
    It seems to say that “most people don’t hold the same opinions, except for
    those that relate to the common good, and so you should concern yourself with
    the common good so that way you can be consistent throughout your life.” (What
    world do you live in? People agree about the common good? Maybe he means this
    in some kind of the same sense in which Aristotle said in his Ethics that
    everyone wants to be happy, and that therefore happiness is the end of
    ethics?)
