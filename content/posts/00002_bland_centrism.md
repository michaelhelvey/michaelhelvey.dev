# Bland Centrism

It’s difficult to uphold the rights, values, desires, and hopes of one group
without seeming to undervalue the same attributes of other groups, especially if
those groups have traditionally held each other in opposition. No example should
be more apropos than the public conversation surrounding the Trump
administration, on both sides, that it is difficult to separate the rhetoric of
populism from the simple cultivation of animosity. “You are valued and
important,” and “you are better than your enemies” are two different, yet
apparently inseparable, notions in political conversation. And not just
political conversation; they appeal to to man’s most basic sin, pride.

Centrists are stuck, it seems, with the blandest rhetoric imaginable. Great
rhetoric, like any other great art, is defined by stark contrasts, alternating
gentle and martial timbres, deep shade and bright glory, and the eternal
conflict of good and evil. By writing about how “the other side is not so bad as
you might think,” you may not stir up much trouble, but you run the danger of
not stirring up much at all. You risk becoming the Haydn quartets of political
discourse; not worth hating, not worth listening to.

Centrism must come from a place of non-centrism, a place of strong beliefs and
stark contrasts between right and wrong, and only become centrist with respect
to some particular conversation, as it were, accidentally.
