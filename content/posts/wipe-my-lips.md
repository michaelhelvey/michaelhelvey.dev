Wipe my lips and bind my back against the mast. Stretch my loosened cheeks and jaw with canvas cloth Now, that I may not with fevered feet go past True bounds to meet unwanted love in sloth. Take my hand and lead me on my way, Past the church of hollow saints and past, Quick, the cave of devils built with clay: Far from sleep and selfish hope held fast. Heart, if once for long you had an enemy Greater than your apathy to love or hate, Then you might give up your quiet blasphemy, Find your joy outside your flesh and future fate. _Envoi_ Holy Mary, pray and watch my wandering soul That in my end both death and life will find me whole.
