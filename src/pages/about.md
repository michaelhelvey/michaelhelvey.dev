Hi there! 👋

I'm a professional software engineer based in Lincoln, NE. I'm also a husband,
father, Christian, and constant student.

- 💻 _Current Stack_: React/Remix/Tailwind/Prisma
- ⚙ _Main Professional Languages_: Javascript (Typescript), PHP, Python, Objective-C, Go
- 👩‍💻 _Favorite Languages_: Rust, most Lisps, Python
- 🏛 _Favorite Frameworks_: Django, Remix, NextJS

I'm a generalist at heart: I love building things, and I love being a part of
every layer of the process. I have deep experience in the modern Javascript
ecosystem, and I'd usually describe myself as a fullstack web developer.
Nevertheless, I've had the opportunity to dive into many other areas in the
course of my career, from cloud architcture, DevOps, or native mobile
development.

In my spare time, I'm always interested in how things work under the hood, and
you'll often find me writing code in system languages like C, Rust, or Zig.

I'm passionate about sustainability and quality in software development, and I
firmly believe that TDD and clean code pays off in the long term for users.
