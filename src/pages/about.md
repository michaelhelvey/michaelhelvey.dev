Hi there! 👋

I'm a professional software engineer based in Lincoln, NE. I'm also a husband, father, Christian,
and constant student.

- ❤️ _Current Favorite Stack_: Rust
- ⚙ _Main Languages I've used at work_: Rust, Javascript (& Typescript), Python, Go, PHP,
  Objective-C
- 👨‍💻 _Favorite Languages_: Rust, most Lisps, C
- 🏛 _Favorite Frameworks_: Django, Remix, Next.js

I'm a generalist at heart: I love building things, and I love being a part of every layer of the
process. I have deep experience in the modern Javascript ecosystem, and I'd usually describe myself
as a fullstack web developer. Nevertheless, I've had the opportunity to dive into many other areas
in the course of my career, such as cloud architcture, DevOps, or native mobile development.

In my spare time, I'm always interested in how things work under the hood, and you'll often find me
writing code in system languages like C, Rust, or Zig.

I'm passionate about sustainability and quality in software development, which is why I tend to
reach for lower level languages and try to understand the details of what I'm working on before
using frameworks & adding dependencies. I want to build software that's fast, simple, and respects
its users: software that will last, and not rot.
