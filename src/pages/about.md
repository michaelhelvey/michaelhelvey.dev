Hi there! 👋

I'm a professional software engineer based in Lincoln, NE. I'm also a husband, father, Christian,
and constant student.

I'm a generalist at heart: I love building things, and I love being a part of every layer of the
process. I have deep experience in the modern Javascript ecosystem, and I'd usually describe myself
as a fullstack web developer. Nevertheless, I've had the opportunity to dive into many other areas
in the course of my career, such as cloud architcture, DevOps, or native mobile development. My
current job is mostly in platform engineering and cloud infrastructure on AWS.

In my spare time, I'm always interested in how things work under the hood, and you'll often find me
writing code in system languages like C, Rust, or Zig.

I'm passionate about sustainability and quality in software development, which is why I tend to
reach for lower level languages and try to understand the details of what I'm working on before
using frameworks & adding dependencies. I want to build software that's fast, simple, and respects
its users: software that will last, and not rot.
