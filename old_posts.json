    "body": "The window—square, with rounded corners—of the airplane was a smoldering, translucent orange, the sun spilling down from the left corner like a slightly burned sauce. Every detail on the window caught the light and shone back at me, the scratches like a complex and abstract drawing. But it was a drawing that told me little, because I had little to tell it. The space of two seats squatted between me and the window. My eyes were puffy and heavy, wanting to sink down into my skull and settle around my nose, the fruit of little sleep. Earphones hid my ears from the world, and my thoughts from myself. In that capacity they were comforting. Because I don’t like to think about the world. I don’t like to think about the world because I don’t like to think about myself. The world demands much, and I am lazy. So I hide. I crawl under the table of reality, afraid of the light and the holy details. Life knocks up against me, and the long, open vowels of the knocks echo in my chest, amongst the hollowness there. It makes me afraid. Life is like a mountain valley, deep in the heart of a strange and magical country. On either side are ridges, the teeth of a yawning mouth. Life in the valley is strange—you never really know if those teeth won’t close on the sky, ripping out a blue, juicy mouthful, leaving you in darkness, scrambling around somewhere near the gullet. The sky can be beautiful at night, but that’s when the wolves start howling in the forests. And the bears—they say the bears eat travelers sometimes. There’s also a lion down at the very end of the valley, where we’re all going. None of us travelers really know what to think about him. Oh, and I nearly forgot, but there are faeries. Of course there are faeries. After a while, the jet returned to the ground, as jets do. I didn’t really notice. I was busy not thinking. Not thinking is hard, but not as hard as thinking itself. So I keep traveling on my pilgrim way down the road, but I don’t know where the road is because it’s dark, and I’m afraid of the dark. But because I’m afraid of the teeth on either side of the valley, and what they might do to the sky, I keep my head well down, down near the beetles and the small insects that eat dead things down on the forest floor. It’s dark down there too, of course, but there are little streaks of light that play through the broken edges of the leaves, and sometimes I can tell what direction they’re coming from if I look closely. Following the light—it sounds so optimistic, when you’re in the dark. Rum thing, isn’t it? I don’t know why I have this need to write about traveling, but I always do it. It’s as if I have to psychologically explain why I would take such a drastic step, uprooting myself from one place and inserting myself into another. I think it’s to explain it to myself more than to others. After all, I like where I was, and I don’t really like where I am, but I’ve convinced myself it’s all for the good, kind of like the pilgrim in the dark who talks about searching for the light as if the word ‘search’ made his darkness less dark. As if talking about it brought some light into the world. And perhaps it does. They call Jesus ‘the Word’, you know. When I arrived at what I now call home, it was raining, and the ground squished under my boots as if all the grains of dirt gave a little gasp and scream when I set my foot down on them. The light on the house shuddered out over the lawn and the wind in the trees gossiped in a harsh whisper. It was all very wet and real. I’m addicted to distractions, is what it is. I don’t like to think about the world because I don’t like what’s inside of myself. And so I distract myself from the world by absorbing myself with the world. The world is its own distraction. Some accuse monks of withdrawing themselves from the world. Of being so heavenly minded they’re no earthly good. In my experience, quite the opposite is true. Only a monk, exiled in his rocky den, far away from anything strong enough to occupy his mind, can really force himself to probe to the heart of the world. That’s the reason for asceticism. I can’t see a tree if I’m in it, my back scraped by its bark and my eyes full of its sticky, leafed twigs. I can only see the tree if I can see the sky also. I just need to see the sky.",

Sometimes shadows flash their half-forgotten forms on the moon-shine in front of me, and I stop to pick at them with short, bitten fingernails before I scramble on. I tell myself the light looks like faces of happy children, perhaps my own. And I see the light and say it would be very good had I not made it, shaping joy with tiny hands. I only need the crevice broken in the wet concrete where I can press through my grimy hands and hair and eyes panicked by the close rock and pumping breath into the light and crowd of happy faces.

He that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. On my violin, my fingers, like alien creatures crawling and groping at the end of my arm, play the hymn. A canopy covers the vault and the heavy, green coffin. The whisper of a quiet sky dulls the bright, plastic blue. The wet flotsam of snow clings to my shoes’ edges, and on the ground, my crumpled jacket lies distorted beside my violin case. Cold wind, curling above the old cemetery, settles and sits quietly, a plank of air on the graves. Douglas Wilson’s bible crinkles and flutters. Grief at a Christian funeral, he says, is like the grief you see at airports. The grief of a farewell to those whom we will not see for a long time. Therefore we wait in earnest hope of the resurrection. Children, cold and happy in huge jackets, are throwing dark crimson onto the coffin. A prickly peak of roses. Rare flurries are sliding down the cold air’s flat plane, angling their way into the scene, resting on the hard graves and the asphalt, on the patient grass, spinning together the tree life, spinning both the living and the dead.",

    "body": "At its core all art is abstract. No art can walk along the dry earth and feel the five-month dead hay stubs cracking beneath it, while reddening at the cold air driving along the tilled valley between the ridges. All art is a rhetorical figure, taking a slippery reality into tiny hands and struggling to hang on to the important piece. The artist must choose. Reality itself slips away like oil while the artist scrabbles on hands and knees in the quick current to catch that tiny shred he can take as a souvenir. A little part suggests the whole; a shark’s tooth invokes the blood-washed maw and thrashing tail. I can’t eat rocks passively. Good art is hard liquor, taking an already potent world and distilling it, boiling away so much, leaving only the strongest bits like a crust. Good art burns your eyeballs and presses against the back of your eyeballs. Popular music is easy listening—producers know their job too well to make you work for pleasure. No shark teeth. Just a soft red chair and potato chips. Ten-proof. Art Lite. Popular music doesn’t imitate reality. It doesn’t distill force and meaning, more concrete than before, out of an already concrete world. If popular music is art, then it is art mixed with a huge quantity of water. It takes a wild and bright world and delivers a product dulled and made from plastic. But I do not think it is art; it is entertainment. I don’t fault it for its entertainment, but only for its presumption to the name of art. My line, a clear flash in the sun, screams while it runs out from my rod. The canoe rests against hot rocks. When the hook settles softly into an eddy, I start to reel it back, squinting at the flashing chops of water. The line pulls taught for a second and drags down the end of the rod. I keep reeling. The water breaks. There it is, clanging against the side of the canoe. It’s small, made of purple plastic, almost white. I think it spent a few days among the sun-scorched beach rocks before the young river asked it along to dance. Sorry, that’s not a real fish.",

    "body": "_A Floregium_\n\n> The culture of death is simultaneously a culture dominated by the notion of \"entertainment.\"  The very notion of entertainment presumes the state of boredom as the norm, which means that a culture increasingly fueled by this notion assumes that our lives are innately and intrinsically meaningless without the constant stream of stimulation and distraction, a stream inevitably subject to the law of diminishing returns. ~Michael Hanby\n\n> What is the dominant mode of experience at the end of the twentieth century?  How do people see things, and how do they expect to see things?  The answer is simple.  In every field, from business to politics to marketing to education, the dominant mode has become entertainment. . . . In other centuries human beings wanted to be saved, or improved, or freed, or educated.  But in our century, they want to be entertained.  The great fear is not of disease or death, but of boredom. ~Michael Crichton\n\n> The life of a television-watcher is a kind of caricature of contemplation.  Passivity, uncritical absorption, receptivity, inertia.  Not only that, but a gradual yielding to the mystic attraction until one is spell-bound in a state of complete union.  The trouble with this caricature is that it is really the exact opposite of contemplation: for true contemplation is precisely the fruit of a most active and intransigent rupture with all that captivates the senses, the emotions, and the will on a material or emotional level.  The contemplative reaches his passivity only after terrific struggle with everything that appeals to his appetites as a half-animal member of the human herd.  He is receptive and still only because the stillness he has reached is lucid, spiritual, and full of liberty.  It is the summit of a life of spiritual freedom.  The other, the ersatz, is the nadir of intellectual and emotional slavery. ~Thomas Merton",

    "title": "Joseph Weizenbaum On Tools",
    "created_at": "Sat, 07 Mar 2015 22:32:54 +0000",
    "body": "Joseph Weizenbaum, one of the great computer scientists of the mid-twentieth century (and author of the instantly-famous ELIZA program), in 1976 wrote _Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to Calculation, _a brilliant examination of the impact of computers on society and human thought.\n\nIn his first chapter, \"On Tools,\" he examines the impact which tools have on the processes they are used on.  The way in which man does something, he says, is intimately tied to _how_ he does it.  \"Man can create little without first imagining that he can create it\" (pg. 18).  Tools shape the imaginations of their users, including creating the belief that the tools are \"necessary\" to the processes that machines aid.  In the same way, Weizenbaum argues, the computer became \"necessary\" the tasks it was used for.\n\n> When the first telegraph line connecting Texas with New York was laid doubts were expressed as to whether the people in those places would have anything to say to one another.  But by the time the digital computer emerged from university laboratories and entered the American business, military, and industrial establishments, there were no doubts about its potential utility . . . Unprecedentedly large and complex computational tasks awaited American society at the end of the Second World War, and the computer, almost miraculously it would seem, arrived just in time to handle them. (pg. 27)\n\nThe indispensability of computers is in many ways a mirage created by the existence of computers.  \"Only rarely,\" he says, \"if indeed ever, are a tool and an altogether original job it is to do, invented together\" (pg. 32).  The impact of computers on society, he says therefore, is not that they transformed _what_ we do, but that they transformed _how_ we do them.  \"If the triumph of a revolution is to be measured in terms of the profundity of the social revisions it entailed, then there has been no computer revolution\" (pg. 32).\n\nIn perhaps the most illuminating passage of all, he argues that this transformation of method can actually _prevent_ work on the real problem from being accomplished:\n\n> The capacity of the human mind for sloppy thinking and for rationalizing, for explaining away the consequences of its sloppy thinking, is very large.  If a particular technique requires an enormous amount of computation and if onlyk a limited computational effort can be devoted to it, then a failure of the technique can easily be explained away on the ground that, because of computational limitations, it was never really tested.  The technique itself is immunized against critical examination by such evasions.  Indeed, it may well be fortified, for the belief that an otherwise faultless and probably enormously powerful technique is cramped by some single limitation tends to lead the devotee to put effort into removing that limitation.  When this limitation seems to him to be entirely computational, and when a computer is offered to help remove it, he may well launch a program of intensive, time-consuming \"research\" aimed simply at \"computerizing\" his technique.  Such programs usually generate subproblems of a strictly computational nature that tend, by virtue of their very magnitude, to increasingly dominate the task and, unless great care is taken to avoid it, to eventually become the center of attention.  As every more investment is made in attacking these initially ancillary subproblems, and as progress is made in cracking them, an illusion tends to grow that real work is being don on the main problem.  (pgs. 35-36)\n\nAdditionally, he argues, all tools presuppose a \"language,\" and themselves constitute a kind of \"language.\"  Because a tool can only be used for certain things, and is manifestly inadequate for others, it naturally dictates, by its nature, what sort of problems are fed through it.  The conclusion we can draw from this idea, related to the modern truism of computers as the predominant processors of information, is apparent.  Computers, because they are the dominant means of processing information, have also become the definition and the language of \"information processing\", and indeed, of thought itself.  \"A computing system that permits the asking of only certain kinds of questions, that accepts only certain kinds of 'data', and that cannot even in principle be understood by those who rely on it, such a computing system has effectively closed many doors that were open before it was installed\" (pg. 38).",

    "title": "Musical Morality: Nietzsche and Wagner",
    "created_at": "Fri, 13 Mar 2015 01:43:44 +0000",
    "body": "Aesthetics is not a popular subject in a culture that bows to the high throne of individual desire. The question of whether art could reflect, much less _motivate_, a philosophical or moral position is anathema, and therefore not often asked. But the answer to this question created modern artistic ethics. If the Church is serious about transforming culture and morals, then she will have to come to a conclusion on this subject. The ethics of Nietzsche (and his postmodern successors) rest upon two fundamental insights: first, that it is impossible to fit the moral universe into the neat systems of Enlightenment philosophers, and second, that without a deity to provide a universal ethical norm, this view leads directly to moral anarchy. Both of these insights are true, and in their truth lies both the value and the tragedy of postmodernism. Nietzsche clearly demonstrated the first by his writings, and the second by his life. In _Beyond Good and Evil_, the most well known of his ethical writings, Nietzsche flatly and provocatively rejects the existence of a “measure of things.” “To recognize untruth,” he says, “as a condition of life: that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so, has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.”[\\[1\\]](#_ftn1) The irony of the work, of course, is that the “good and evil” which Nietzsche claims to go beyond is itself subject to his moral evaluation. He substitutes for a universal measure of things a subjective, individual measure of things; he has created a measure which excludes measures. This is the paradox which has driven some postmodernists to nihilism. Nietzsche therefore condemns the “Tartuffery of old Kant,”[\\[2\\]](#_ftn2) and wryly comments that all philosophy consists basically in the personal confessions of the philosopher. Every philosophy is pregnant with a moral system, patterned after the life and desires of the philosopher. Thus Nietzsche leans back, with devilish good cheer, to poke his needle into every point of ethical philosophy, fully aware that every prick draws the blood, not only of the philosophy he criticizes, but of his own system also. _Beyond Good and Evil_, therefore, is less of a philosophical system and more of an ethical statement of apathy. Nietzsche is the cynic who will engage in any number of calculated obscenities merely to embarrass and dismantle the fragile and artificial structure around him. A man who deliberately infects himself with syphilis could hardly be anything else. In the fall of 1861, a friend named Gustav Krug gave the seventeen-year-old Nietzsche a piano score of Wagner’s innovative work, _Tristian und Isolde_. As Nietzsche described it in his book _Ecce Homo,_ “From the moment that _Tristan_ was arranged for the piano, I was a Wagnerite.”[\\[3\\]](#_ftn3) For the music of Wagner was itself an ethical statement, of a remarkably similar kind to Nietzsche’s. Wagner was a passionate man, in both his morals and aesthetics. He was enthralled by nationalism, individual libertinism, and the romantic fascination with personal feeling and longing. In the rejection of moral form, Wagner also rejected the harmonic forms of music. In _Tristan,_ perhaps Wagner’s most exemplary and innovative work, he consciously flaunts the conventions of western harmony, foiling the expectations of his listeners with wandering chromaticism. There seems be no order to his progressions as he bounces from one key to another, all characterized by the unsatisfied yearning of his pinching, chromatic melodies. He uses the unsatisfied yearning of chromaticism to symbolize the sexual desire he celebrated in his art and life. But most fascinating about Wagner’s work is its philosophical and aesthetic consequences. _Tristan_ has rightly been called the first work of atonal music, because of its abandonment of any clear harmonic order. But it is also an expression of musical nihilism: without any governing order, without any objective principle to determine the expectations, tensions, and resolutions necessary to music, harmony can have no meaning. Notes can only have meaning in relationship to one another, and when that relationship is destroyed, they become meaningless points in auditory space, stagnant water, flowing nowhere. From this general and brief statement of Wagner’s aesthetics and their effect upon Nietzsche, we can derive two related conclusions. Firstly, the lack of an overarching _moral_ system directly reflects itself by the lack of an overarching _aesthetic_ system. Secondly, this relationship means that _aesthetic statements_ have direct implications for _moral behavior_. The modern world alternates between love and hate for these conclusions, since, on the one hand, they are the reason for nearly every modern aesthetic movement, and yet on the other, firmly denied by all. The rock music of the sixties gladly identified itself as moral and religious expression in which the moral apathy of Nietzsche was celebrated with Dionysian frenzies.   As E. Michael Jones said in his work _Dionysius Rising_, “As Nietzsche could have told them \\[rock musicians\\], music is the characteristic Dionysian art, and intoxication its primary effect.”[\\[4\\]](#_ftn4) Yet very few modern people (and especially Christians, ironically enough) are willing to admit to the moral consequences of artistic expression, since such an admission would imply that morality is subject to the same relativism as aesthetic taste, and shatter the convenient fiction that one can be both moral and thoroughly secular. The effect of Wagner’s music on the young Nietzsche was the result of a strictly logical argument. Firstly, ethics, at the most fundamental level, studies the relationship between human actions and a moral code. Secondly, music is universally acknowledged to produce emotions in the human soul: some music is “sad,” some music is “happy,” and so on. Finally, emotion, taken at its literal meaning, is a motion of the soul out of one state and into another, and therefore emotion, when taken in conjunction with a decision between two courses of action, is capable of providing a _motivation._ The logical conclusion of these three points is that since music through its emotive power is capable of producing motivation to a course of action, and since a course of action is, by definition, the subject of ethical analysis, _music necessarily has ethical consequences._ This was the insight of Nietzsche and Wagner that was so influential in creating modern ethics, and yet at the same time the insight consistently rejected by modern Christianity in its apathy towards the arts. Of course the conclusion, hackneyed as it is, to be drawn from this thesis is that Christians must be more discriminating in their artistic consumption and production. But we must move forward from this platitude to a more radical application. A Church which is lazy or compromised in its artistic expression is at best inconsistent, and at worst guilty of surrender to secularism at the most fundamental level. We Christians love to complain about the world. The world has abandoned morality, and common sense with it, we cry. But a word of caution: the world has not abandoned morality—that is impossible—but it has substituted its own system in place of it. And, moreover, the most potent expression of this secular morality is not found in the abortion clinic, or in the corrupt political machine, but in art. Yet, for all this, the Church remains apathetic to art. God is a God of harmony, of color, of form, of story. Until we can carry on the great canon of western literature, until we can bear forward the standard of the Christian artists and musicians of the past, why should we be surprised that we lack the moral potency to overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil? So once again create buildings that dance and soar in the joyful air, stories that probe and poke at the heart of humanity, music that reflects in its form and harmony the order of the world, and art that motivates our souls and bodies to righteousness. And then, as St. John wrote, and as it is so famously sung in Handel’s _Messiah,_ “The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.”[\\[5\\]](#_ftn5)\n\n* * *\n\n_Notes:_ [\\[1\\]](#_ftnref1) Friedrich Nietzsche, _The Philosophy of Nietzsche_ (New York: Modern Library, 1954), 384.

    "body": "Apathy is at the root of modernity. Apathy is the heart of entertainment, and by ‘entertainment’ I mean not only the film or music industry, but the entire, passive philosophy of living which sluggishly floats through the veins of modern life. We would rather receive than give, and in a horrible inversion of Christ’s proverb, even what we have received is in danger of being taken from us. According to the official website, the [Microsoft HoloLens](http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us) will usher in a “new reality.” A reality created by the same people who couldn’t interest themselves in the world beyond their computer screens if it bit them in the face. “When you change the way you see the world, you can change the world you see,” they say. _Why_ you would want to change the world, or _what_ you would want to change it to, they do not say. It is unimportant. As a matter of course, they presume that their world is better than the real world. Everything tastes better with a Ritz; the priests of technology have spoken. But my objection to the HoloLens is not confined solely to hologram technology. I could complain about how it will absorb people, and keep them from nature, and a whole horde of objections rather reminiscent of the 19th century romantics. My objections to it, rather, lie in its motivations. It claims to make life better, but the use of the word ‘better’ assumes some sort of goal, some end towards which the HoloLens will push us. I am to believe that the generous, altruistic creators of this technology did so with an ideal for humanity in mind. I began this critique with a condemnation of apathy. Apathy is the motivation behind the HoloLens. The ideal towards which the HoloLens pushes us is one in which our minds receive more, and act less. You have to _work_ to interact with the real world; holograms are tame, and infinitely malleable. A device which allows us to visualize our dreams runs the risk of making our vision no more than a dream, and just as meaningless. To object that the hologram can have great uses in science, or dramatically improve design efficiency, or be capable of any number of “good” uses, is to use blinders in a discussion with wide, and far-ranging implications. Can holograms aid scientific discovery? I would respond to this and all other such apologies for the HoloLens by objecting that we cannot ask such a narrow, specific question before we consider the larger implications. What kind of man does the HoloLens create? That is the question which must be answered before more specific questions can even be brought to the table, and it is a question pregnant with all sorts of ethical and metaphysical implications: what is a man? what does it mean for him to be good? The version of reality which the HoloLens seeks to create, and the ways of thought which it encourages, are the fruit of the apathy which I have already criticized. As such, the HoloLens must be condemned on the basis of its motivations. Whether intentional or not, the HoloLens is destructive of purposeful thought; it is a castration of the mind. When we seek to live in a hologram of a world, we risk becoming only a hologram of humanity.",

Only later did I notice the resemblance of the mayonnaise (ladled on by the handful) to pus, and the bun’s disturbing habit of oozing grease just as a dying warrior in the _Iliad_ did blood. The hamburger patty itself, I became convinced, was a close relative to the Dead Sea—both are, after all, flat, extremely salty, and completely incapable of supporting life. The fries wilted like wet ferns on the forest floor after a thunderstorm (in which the principle precipitation involved grease and salt). The soda, like all of its kind, left my mouth shriveled and prickling, and did not satisfy thirst. The shriveled raisin of my tongue curled up at the bottom of my mouth and wept. At the request of my outraged throat, I vowed to never again subject myself to such treatment, but in the pit of my stomach (probably near the spot where the yellow, desiccated lettuce was fermenting) I felt the fate that would lead me back through those dirty glass doors, over those crumb-pocked floors, to that mound of doom called, so optimistically, a Wendy’s hamburger.",

    "body": "At several points in the Chronicles of Narnia, Lewis seems to hint at a vision of Narnia which perhaps yields good fruit with regard to his love for fairy tales and \"children's stories.\"  Usually Narnia stands apart, utterly separate from our world, with very little commentary on the relationship between its world and our own.  But on a few occasions, Lewis steps back from this strict distinction and addresses how they might interlock.  Narnia is literally a fairy-tale world, but eventually subsumes the \"real\" world. In _The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, _Lucy notes, when the Pevensies are about to take coats from the Professor's wardrobe, that \"we won't really even be taking them out of the wardrobe.\"  Their journey into Narnia is real, yet when they return, no time has passed, and they \"return\" to their proper ages (the issue of time is important here).  In _Prince Caspian, _the Pevensies are called into the world, ancient kings and queens from another age of the world, who have the same mythos that Merlin would have if he returned to modern England. In _The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, _Caspian, on learning that the Pevensies live on a round world, explodes in wonder, \"Oh, I'd give anything--I wonder why you can get into our world and we never get into yours?  If only I had the chance!\"  Combine this with Rilian's statement in _The Last Battle, _on learning that Digory and Polly are still living in our world: \"Lord Digory and Lady Polly, from the dawn of the world, and still in your place!  Wonder and glory!\" What can we learn from these isolated incidents?  Within Narnia, our world (and the people there) are often thought of as demi-gods, or at least great heroes who only intrude into Narnia in order to save it from a great evil.  This is a common literary trope, but it passes unnoticed because, in this case, the heroes are children.  Great ages pass in Narnia while no time at all passes in our world, yielding our heroes a kind of immortality. The theme of apparently small spaces grown large is also a common theme, one which will, in fact, lead me to my principal subject and conjecture regarding Lewis' theory of fairy tales.  Not only is this mentioned in the earlier example of the wardrobe, but also in _The Last Battle_ when the kings and queens observe that \"once, in our world, a stable held something which was bigger than our whole world.\"  By means of a childlike imagination (but not a childish one), the small is made large and real.  By means of a prosaic and \"grown-up\" imagination (like that of the dwarves who refuse \"to be taken in\"), the large is made small and trite. We can note from these examples that Narnia is, in many ways, described functionally a \"small space\" which is made large and real by childlike imagination, like a dollhouse whose characters enlarged and animated because of the imagination of the children who play with it.  But if Lewis were content to leave it this way, it would be disturbingly abstract, almost Gnostic in its head-patting affirmation of \"the value of imagination.\"  Instead Lewis sits back and snickers jovially at the modernists, because Narnia, in the world of the series, is actually a _real_ place.  It is so real, and so large, in fact, that it overtakes and subsumes \"our\" world, which is presented (as we have seen) throughout the series as inherently larger and more real than Narnia.  Lewis turns the real world/fairy-tale world distinction, which he subtly built up through the series, on its head, when the kings and queens stand in Aslan's garden, and look out over the world and see England, far away, like a peninsula jutting out from Aslan's country. Lewis sets up Narnia as a dollhouse, a small space made larger by the imaginations of children, in the midst of \"the real world\" and then inverts the picture, showing \"the real world\" to be the dollhouse, and the fairy tale to be the reality.  Like Chesterton in _Orthodoxy, _extolling the virtues of fairy tales and insisting that the real world _is_ a fairy tale, Lewis shows the cynical, materialistic moderns to be like the dwarves who \"will not be taken in.\"  The real, fairy-tale world is huge and beautiful.  It is only made into a tiny, dark stable by the effort of the dwarves.  (Perhaps it was an intentional irony that Lewis gave this cynical role to dwarves, who are physically small.)  Lewis is making a remarkably Chestertonian point about the world: in reality, it is magical; it is made prosaic only by our lack of faith.  We do not need imagination, but rather eyes.  We don't need to imagine the magic of the world, but rather to peel off our rationalist blindfolds and see what is already there.  As Aslan said, for too long have we been so afraid of being taken in, that we cannot be taken out.\n\n> \"One word, Ma'am,\" he said, coming back from the fire; limping, because of the pain.  \"One word.  All you've been saying is quite right, I shouldn't wonder.  I'm a chap who always like to know the worst and then put the best face I can on it.  So I won't deny any of what you said.  But there's on thing more to be said, even so.  Suppose we _have _only dreamed, or made up, all those things--trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself.  Suppose we have.  Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones.  Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours _is _the only world.  Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one.  And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it.  We're just babies making up a game, if you're right.  But four babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow.  That's why I'm going to stand by the play world.  I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it.  I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia.  So, thanking you kindly for our supper, if these two gentlemen and the young lady are ready, we're leaving your court at once and setting out in the dark to spend our lives looking for Overland.  Not that our lives will be very long, I should think; but that's small loss if the world's as dull a place as you say.\" ~_The Silver Chair, _158-59",

Neither do I want to pontificate over the two people who were shot in Ferguson in protest over Michael Brown, in whose name yet more blood is shed at the altar of social peace and equality. I would simply like to make a simple observation: to support life by wreaking death, and to make war for the sake of peace, forces the thinking citizens of America to question the motivations of those involved.  The massive, racially charged riots in Baltimore, I must contend, have very little to do with Freddie Gray.  Gray is a name, a shield behind which agitators push forward their own game and goals.  Neither is Michael Brown's death the cause of the violence in Ferguson. This is revolutionary violence proceeding under the name of a self-pity party and mutual backscratching contest.  Revolutionaries have always loved a nice front, the more \"righteous\" and \"just\" the better.  Communist Russia committed its violence against its own citizens while crying out for financially and cultural \"justice.\"  Nazi Germany insisted on \"purity.\"  Revolutionary France sent tens of thousands of its own citizens to the guillotine for the sake of \"equality,\" and \"fraternity.\" But none of these movements have ever been about purity, righteousness, love, fraternity, or justice.  Even the most naive and optimistic of historians willingly grants this.  Yet when in our own time, in the streets of America, we see the same violence, the same blood-letting, the same vitriolic pitting of some groups against others in the name of \"justice,\" \"righteousness,\" and \"equality,\" we refuse to learn the lessons of history.  We refuse to cast on these events the eye of historically-informed doubt, even for a moment, for fear that we might be insensitive, or (gasps all round) racist. We don't want to be sacrificed ourselves, and so we rush down, sycophantically, to the temple of Not Hurting Anybody's Feelings and worship softly in a corner by ourselves, and try not to hear the screams of human sacrifice. Where there's smoke and mirrors, there's probably magic.  Riots for the sake of justice are not what they seem.",

    "body": "_The Impact of the Resurrection On Writing and Criticism_\n\nAnton Chekhov famously said that the purpose of fiction is to tell the truth. All literary theories depend on the definition of truth, on the construction of the all-encompassing system by which the words of the world ought to be measured. Pilate famously asked, “What is truth,” and in the answer is contained the nature of the world, of man, and of man’s moral duty in the world. Pilate asked his question to Christ, the man and God who shortly died, but in three days rose again according to the Scriptures. In this resurrection he accomplished the renewal of all creation, bending again a bent world back to the straight symmetry for which it was first created. In Christ God became man, bringing the infinite God into finite flesh, the ultimate union of the divine with the mundane, of the metaphysical with the physical, of the reality with the image. The man who was God, standing in a public place surrounded by men created in his image, after his likeness, was asked how he could say “I have come down from heaven.” In reply, he said, “Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.” By membership with this Christ, by partaking through this concrete, physical sacrament of communion with his body, man partakes in the resurrection of Christ. The world is a sacrament, in which the physical and the metaphysical embrace, in which the creation is ennobled by the incarnation of its creator. Moreover, the salvation of the world rests not merely in some spiritualization, in some abstraction whereby the real becomes a cloud, but in Christ’s resurrection from the dead, in the rising of a physical body made still more physical. As Father Capon wrote, “One real thing is closer to God than all the diagrams in the world.”[\\[1\\]](#_ftn1) Man was created a hungry being, and food is made a sacrament. If fiction is to be an true mirror, if it is to tell the truth about the world, it is nothing if not sacramental. Fiction points to the reality, not beyond the world, but wrapped up with the world. The Eucharist does not interpret Christ for us because it is alien from Christ, separated by flesh from a disembodied existence, but instead it presents Christ to us bodily. The bread is bread, and yet is Christ; in the wine we find both grape-skins and yeast, and yet the same blood which poured from the side of our Lord as he swallowed up death by death. In the same way fiction interprets the world it presents, not by divorcing itself from the world we touch and taste, nor by ignoring the metaphysical and moral significance of every concrete detail, but by presenting both intimately bound up with one another. Just as the physical world does, just as the bread and wine of the Eucharist do, just as Christ does. C. S. Lewis, in his essay on “Transposition,” makes this very point of another art form, the picture. “Pictures are part of the visible world themselves and represent it only by being part of it. . . If I had to name the relation I should call it not symbolical but sacramental.”[\\[2\\]](#_ftn2) In imaginative literature, the spiritual and metaphysical becomes concrete, incarnate. In the last part of this essay, having already taken the term ‘transposition’—which “occurs whenever the higher reproduces itself in the lower”[\\[3\\]](#_ftn3)—and applied it to the relationships between art and reality, between God and man, he turns to the resurrection. The relation of art to reality, he says, parallels the relation between present humanity and resurrected humanity. Reality itself can stand out under the giant sky, and see from one hazy horizon to the other. Although fiction is, in comparison, a telescoped view, it nevertheless partakes of the same reality, just as our present bodies partake of the same flesh with their resurrected counterparts. Fiction, as a necessary result of its close binding with the eternal and metaphysical—I can even say, the divine—is inherently _moral_. John Gardner, the late writer and critic, said that “art is essentially and primarily moral—that is, life-giving—moral in its process of creation and moral in what it says.”[\\[4\\]](#_ftn4) The moral framework of the world does not exist independently of its relation with the divine, but rather _in_ its relation with the divine. Gardner carries this definition to its logical conclusion: “If art destroys good, mistaking it for evil, then that art is false, an error; it requires denunciation.”[\\[5\\]](#_ftn5) But there is another pitfall. The trap of evangelical art is that, while upholding “good” in the face of “evil,” it lies about the world by describing and defining good and evil incorrectly. It attempts to divorce morality from truth. Instead of making sense of the world through the sacramental union of the physical and the spiritual, of truth and morality, it abstracts its moral system from the concrete. Insofar as it makes this abstraction its creed, it is Gnostic, rather than incarnational. Morality is not something separate from the world in which it exists. Just as it is impossible to understand God without grasping the self (and vice-versa), it is likewise impossible for fiction to be moral without articulating the world truthfully. Peter Leithart, in is essay, “Why Evangelicals Can’t Write,” diagnoses the Gnostic fiction of evangelicalism as a sacramental error. “Modern Protestants,” he says, “can’t write because we have no sacramental theology.”[\\[6\\]](#_ftn6) Flannery O’Connor, a model of sacramental writing, and an outspoken critic of the latent Gnosticism so characteristic of modern fiction, wrote that, “The Manicheans separated spirit and matter. To them all material things were evil. They sought pure spirit and tried to approach the infinite directly without any mediation of matter. This is also pretty much the modern spirit, and for the sensibility infected with it, fiction is hard if not impossible to write because fiction is so much an incarnational art.”[\\[7\\]](#_ftn7) Instead, she says, it is the duty of the Christian artist to penetrate “the concrete world, in order to find at its depths the image of its source, the image of ultimate reality.”[\\[8\\]](#_ftn8) The concrete marks of Manichean fiction are a sentimental piety that shirks truth in favor of nicety, and finds the morality of a work in surface details and content rather than in its likeness with the world we touch and know. Flannery O’Connor’s story, “A Good Man Is Hard To Find,” for example, the Gnostic could condemn as immoral; after all, evil triumphs over good (the Misfit shoots all the decent people), and good itself is noticeably absent (the central character, the granny, is self-righteous and corrupt until just before she is mercilessly shot). But as O’Connor herself wrote, the reader who submits to such a superficial analysis “has reduced his conception of the supernatural to pious cliché and has become able to recognize nature in literature in only two forms, the sentimental and the obscene.”[\\[9\\]](#_ftn9) “A Good Man Is Hard To Find” is not a fairy tale; its characters do not live happily ever after following the final defeat of evil. The central issue is its truth: its characters are accurate, and good and evil are described truthfully. If the evil described is truly evil, then we that it is impossible for it to _ultimately_ triumph over good, and it is this knowledge which allows us to interpret correctly a story, such as O’Connor’s, in which good seems to be beaten down on this temporal plane of sin and death. It is the first task of the critic, therefore, rather than taking the author’s descriptions of good and evil for granted, to ask whether they are true. It is only _because_ of this truth in O’Connor’s story that we can find the grace hidden behind the hard reality. But, it might be objected, could not this be merely a Christianization of the same license to obscenity which so many secular writers have claimed and used to excess? No: we have seen two types of untruth in fiction, both born from the same stock, but expressing themselves in the twin vices of sentimentality and obscenity. On the one hand we find fiction (so often celebrated in the secular world) which attempts truth without morality, leaving only empty obscenity. On the other, we find evangelical fiction which has, in reaction, flung itself in the other direction, attempting to exposit a moral system without regard to truth. Both of these approaches, as we have seen, fail to give either an accurate or a moral account of the world. The obscene is condemned as thoroughly as the sentimental, for both are the fruit of a Gnostic (and therefore untruthful) description of the world. I began this essay by stating that the definition of truth is the defining mark of any literary theory. We have seen that this truth is only attainable by a sacramental view of the world brought out from the incarnation and resurrection. As N. T. Wright put it, “a proper grasp of the (surprising) _future_ hope held out to us in Jesus Christ leads directly and, to many people, equally surprisingly, to a vision of the _present_ hope that is the basis of all Christian mission.”[\\[10\\]](#_ftn10) In the resurrection we find our hope in the renewal of the physical by the bringing together of the rift torn between the human and the divine through sin. Only through this hope in the bodily resurrection can fiction, as O’Connor said, find at the depths of the concrete world an image of ultimate reality.\n\n* * *\n\n[\\[1\\]](#_ftnref1) Robert Farrar Capon, _The Supper of the Lamb,_ (New York: Modern Library, 2002), 21.

His bowtie was askew, the silk handkerchief in his suit coat the recent victim of a sneeze. Breathing heavily, he considered discarding his bowtie, and unfastening the top button of his shirt, but then as the gravity of the situation coiled and hissed in his stomach, he thought better of it. The soul of J. Kevin Pennyworth was not calm and quiet, neither was it like a weaned child with its mother. More like a terrified rodent in a cobra exhibit, really.\n\nHe had been sipping his morning coffee, drawing peaceful breaths and curling his moustache around his little finger. But then Darren, the director of the College’s program of artificially intelligent exams, had burst through the door with the face of a recently startled chimpanzee. “There’s . . . there’s a problem,” he wheezed. “A problem?” Pennyworth asked, and gave his moustache a vicious twist. “With the exam.” “Finals were two days ago.” “I know. Shortly after the students took the exam, evidence started cropping up that they had remembered what they had learned.   The test administrators immediately put the dangerous subjects under quarantine, of course, but today they reported that the problem is wider than we thought. I mean, they thought. I didn’t know until this morning.” “How wide of a problem?” Pennyworth asked, his eyes beginning to bulge like those of a prawn. “Possibly the whole graduating class.” “Can’t they all be quarantined?” “The professors, sir . . . they’re panicking. Saying they might sue the College for not maintaining a safe work environment.” Pennyworth’s stomach writhed like a nervous rat snake. It was in this manner that he arrived at the door of Dr. Peiro, clutching at the door handle. “Come in,” Dr. Peiro’s voice said through the door. Pennyworth entered. The room was quiet, and rather dark. Pennyworth could hear the blood in his ears. A long Persian rug’s length away, beyond a dark cherry desk and silhouetted before the tall, curtained windows, stood the ample form of Dr. Peiro. Dr. Peiro was very large, very old, and had been president of the College since before anyone could remember. His eyes were like soft, liquid pools of dragon’s blood. (Dragon’s blood is a very dark red, almost black.) His mouth and cheeks were like a Bible, not in the sense that they spoke truth, but in that they were very large, and flapped about when he spoke. “There’s a problem, sir,” Pennyworth said. “With the exam.” Dr. Peiro sat down abruptly. “A problem?” he said, his jowls quivering. Pennyworth narrated the story he had heard from Darren, all the while attempting to appear as small as possible on the giant rug. Dr. Peiro was silent for a long time, and then slithered forward over the desk, and whispered into Pennyworth’s face. Pennyworth could feel spit. “Do you understand what this means? The long tradition of excellence maintained without fail since the Revolution, the long tradition of excellence with which we have coaxed the best and brightest of our nation to the school, is threatened by the most imminent destruction.” Pennyworth raised his hands to his head, and seized his hair with both fists. He could almost feel the gray hairs sprouting up between his fingers. “What do you want me to do, sir?” he asked. Dr. Peiro inched a little closer, darting his dragon-blood eyes about the room. “I don’t know,” he said. Just then they were interrupted by a pounding at the door. Dr. Peiro lifted himself up from his desk with what closely resembled the hop of a very fat rabbit. Through the door burst the professors, shouting and gesticulating. Pennyworth was knocked to the floor, where he gripped the carpet with his fingernails. Standing up, strings of carpet poking from his fingers, he saw Dr. Peiro surrounded by the milling crowd. He thought briefly of comparing the scene to Orpheus surrounded by the shades of Hades, but then remembered that Orpheus’ resemblance to an ancient toad was probably very small. One professor, as thin and stiff as a wood plank and clean-shaven, demanded safe asylum from the inevitable result of the students being released into the world. Another shouted that the very definition of education was under assault. Dr. Peiro flapped his hands, and gradually a fevered quiet descended into the room. “Friends, fellow teachers,” he said, walking over towards the windows, “I understand your just concern over the disaster which has overtaken us. But we are reasonable men, and I must insist that we conduct ourselves reasonably even with respect to this imminent danger. I would like to call to your attention the principles of the Revolution, upon which this most revered institution was founded. The purpose of this institution is to provide to the young men and women of our nation an education, an education of excellence, an education which will suitably prepare them to succeed in our modern world. As our forefathers duly noted, this education is not about _facts_, or the cultivation of specific truths, as was once taught in the defunct nations of the western world. No, this education is about principles, processes of creative thinking, and the accumulation of valuable experience. For these reasons, our forefathers developed an exam intelligent enough to discern what the student should remember, and what he would not. By this means, the student is freed from others’ ideas and the crushing weight of others’ truths. Friends, today we have witnessed a glitch in this exam. We must not let ourselves be fazed. How many were our forefathers willing to kill in the Revolution in order to bring us to the place we now enjoy? We must not shirk our responsibilities now. Imprison all the students and we—the world—shall be safe.” Dr. Piero’s address was met by some weak applause. Then Pennyworth spoke up. “Sir,” he said. “Wasn’t the Revolution all about challenging assumptions? All the principles of the Revolution stressed the necessity of not falling back on merely traditional mentalities and fears. Perhaps the danger of simply letting the students go would be less than we think.” The room fell as silent as death, as Dr. Peiro and the professors all turned to face Pennyworth, white-faced. “Are you suggesting that we should turn these students—learned students—over to the world, still full of facts and ideas?” asked Dr. Peiro, in a strange, wavering voice. Pennyworth took a step back. “Well, I don’t know, sir. I’m just asking the question.” The professors instantly began whispering among themselves. “What would become of us?” asked one. “Wasn’t he in the room with the exam this morning?” said another. “He’s been infected.” The words “infection” and “exposure,” were soon hissing around the room, and the professors, an angry mob, made a rush at Pennyworth. “But, the principles of the Revolution!” Pennyworth shouted over the mad screams. “Damn principles! He’s been infected!” a professor shouted. They seized Pennyworth, and bore him violently down the stairs. His head struck again and again against the wall, he began to grow dizzy. He felt like he was being pulled apart. Then a sudden blow struck him once again, and he blacked out. When he awoke, all was quiet. He was first struck by the headache pounding through his ears, and the stifling cold of the smooth, concrete floor against which his nose was pressed. Very slowly, he raised his head and looked around. He was surrounded by the gray, concrete walls, and the darkness of the school’s dungeon. He wondered, briefly, for what reason such a place had ever been built. He shuddered to think of what hard realities must have motivated his esteemed forefathers in its construction. His cell was tiny, with a slit of a window allowing air in from the outside, and another window, gridded with bars, communicating with the next cell. The floor was bare, except for a straw mat, and in place of a pillow, a single volume entitled _The Educational Principles of the Revolution: A Dialectical Approach._ Alone, hungry, and cold, he thought of shedding a bitter tear, and perhaps even giving an existentialist soliloquy. But then he considered how there would be no one to hear him, and no means by which his noble existence could be commemorated by future generations, and so thought better of it. Suddenly he heard footsteps in the cell next to him, and looked up towards the black bars of the window. A face, young and with a hint of a beard, poked itself up. “Hullo,” it said. “Are you also a learned man?” Pennyworth almost leaped out of his skin.",

    "body": "As the New York Times gleefully reports, in the wake of the Charleston shooting, “Within five days, decades of resistance in South Carolina, a state that had held fiercely to its Confederate identity, fell away.” The unchangeably “racist symbol” of the Confederate flag will be removed from the capitol grounds, from Nascar races, and from [Bubba Watson’s car](http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2015/07/03/bubba-watson-removing-confederate-flag-from-his-generall-lee/). The truly surprising thing is quickly and unanimously these “decades of resistance” have disappeared. Suddenly and completely, a symbol that was recognized throughout the South as a relatively innocent symbol of Southern heritage and pride, was, within five days of a shooting, acknowledged as irretrievably racist. This is not the first shooting to have occurred in the South. This is not the first racially motivated attack on black people to have been committed in the South. Yet now, for the first time, the Confederate flag gets the blame. What changed? A shooting did not show up the flag as what it really was. By definition, nothing can “show up” a symbol for “what is really is.” The word “gay” does not refer to homosexuality today because in the last few decades we all suddenly came to the collective realization that in its essence it isn’t a synonym for “happy”, and that we’ve all been using it wrongly for about a thousand years. A word, like a flag, is a symbol, and it’s meaning is entirely dependent on the meaning invested in it _by the people who use it._ Society started using “gay” to mean “homosexual”, and behold, the meaning of “gay” was changed. The meaning of the Confederate flag is dictated by the behavior of those who use it. In the 1860’s, the flag was a symbol of a slave-owning people. Whether or not that ownership of slaves was racist is beside the point, but it does establish that the only period in history at which that flag could justifiably have been considered racist is over and past. Since almost no one who uses the flag today owns slaves, supports the reinstitution of slavery, or in any way oppresses black people, declaring the flag to be a “racist” symbol is almost laughable. A symbol has to _stand_ for something. Would the slave-owning, confederate flag waving section of America please stand up? Nevertheless, it is obvious that in the last two weeks the meaning of the flag has changed, and yet the behavior of the Americans who use the flag has not. It could be objected that the Charleston shooter used the flag, but thousands of atrocities have been committed under and in the name of the American flag, not least of which the War Between the States itself, and nobody has yet suggested tearing down _that._ If no one’s behavior has changed, how has the meaning of the flag changed? We live in a peculiar society where “meaning” is denied to exist in any ultimate sense, but is merely assigned to things by the village star chamber, and the rest of us just follow along because we want to be cool too. This is also, of course, why any kind of objection to the chamber is put down so ruthlessly—the chamber is only cool as long as everybody thinks it is. The members of the chamber are understandably insecure about their identity, since that too it something made up by themselves, and so to question the ideological decisions of the chamber is to question the very being of it. By the star chamber, of course, I refer to all those who find their identity in finding some special status separate from the rest of society: black people who find their identity in being “oppressed by whites”, gay people who find their identity in being “oppressed by straights”, women who find their identity in being “oppressed by the patriarchal system” and so on. Not having a religion, history, or traditional culture to ground themselves in, Americans have to find their identities in one of these special status groups, or at the very least, tag along behind by supporting the groups and cheering them on. But since the groups only exist by virtue of their popularity, they have to lay a no-criticism rule on those from the outside. They are the emperor with no clothes on, surrounded by a crowd of sycophants who find their identity in the fact that they can “see” the clothes. Nobody is allowed to treat the emperor as he really is—a naked fat man marching down the street—because to do that would not just embarrass the emperor, but destroy the identity of all the watching thousands who are proud of “seeing” the clothes. What does this have to do with the Confederate flag? In the last two weeks we have witnessed the naked emperor parading out into the street with a new set of “clothes.” The sycophantic response of our whole society to a few people’s plea that the flag is “racist” is merely the desperate ploy of an entire generation trying to pretend it has not spent its life standing out in the street watching a naked fat man. It is the vain attempt of a culture to conceal the emptiness at its heart, its lack of roots, the fact that it has no real identity. If its own arbitrarily created meanings are destroyed or ignored, there is no meaning left. No purpose, no truth, no hope; only the stark horror of emptiness. It is not racism we fear, but rather the exposure of our souls to the fact that we have no standard or foundation on which to define racism—or if we could define it—on which to condemn it. The “decades of resistance” the New York Times spoke of fell so quickly because it had no meaning, ontological or moral, on which to stand. But this should offer some note of instruction to those of us who are conservatives, who wish to preserve the old customs, the old religion. For it is not the task of preservation which we must set ourselves to, but the task of building. Even those elements in our society which we recognize and approve of are but ghosts of a time already gone, because their foundation was ripped out long ago. For our society to be saved from its sins, it must be saved from itself, and its own self-imposed identities. We must look with pity upon its desperate and laughable ploys to hide itself from the growing realization that there is no purpose, no point, and no meaning. The horror of emptiness is growing clearer by the day, and the madness will not hold out for long. Culture can only be built on a standard, and lives can only be lived with an identity and a purpose. It requires, dare I say, a Savior, before our society can be saved. Crying out that the emperor has no clothes will do nothing to save the crowds. Only a new emperor will do.",

    "body": "> “Christianity is the life and death and resurrection of Christ going on day after day in the souls of individual men and in the heart of society.” ~Thomas Merton\n\nJust beyond the little town of Potlatch, among the wheat fields of the Palouse hills, across the railroad tracks, up the two thin lanes of Rock Creek Road, and a winding gravel driveway, there is a farmhouse, and woods, and a long hayfield over which you can see the distant shadow of Moscow Mountain in the south. Every summer for three years now I’ve come there, to read the works of a Church father aloud with a group of friends. The farm is Wes Callihan’s, whom we affectionately call our phlegmatic Irish abbot, and who ten years ago—when the program started—christened the farm Hill Abbey. Two years ago, we read St. Augustine’s _City of God_, beginning with the contemplations of Thomas Merton in the short introduction, continuing through the slow rhythms of Roman divinities and the theology of Varro. We finally came to the saint’s warm and quiet heart in the nineteenth book; “the peace of all things is the tranquility of order,” he wrote. Wrapped in that contemplation, our days pressed between the pillars of morning and evening prayers, we reached the ends of the City of God and the City of Man in the twenty-fourth book, two weeks after we began. Sometimes we read in camp chairs on the grass, sometimes huddled on the boards of the front deck, sometimes packed into the basement library with the smell of cigars and old hardcovers. The slow voices were a liturgy, gradually moving from the founding of human civilizations to the resurrection of the orderly heavens, eternity shut in a span of words. I arrived full of the pretensions of the wide world, full of the pretension of the white glossy letters emblazoned across a dustcover, larger than the title, which we look at and say, “here is a man who has seen and understood the world.” I wanted to change the world; no problem was too great to escape the breadth of my philosophy in those days. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* The Freeze cemetery is perched atop a long hill not far from Potlatch, far enough from the state road that the only sound is the rustle of the pines—so large that two people cannot embrace them—and soft wind in my ears. There is a permanence to that small country church, surrounded by a century and a half of graves, with its chipped, white sideboards, wooden double doors, and creaky floor. The wind and silence enveloped me. The broad horizon stretched out on the Palouse hills. When I returned to the Hill, there would be baked chicken, and a bonfire, and cigars. But then, I was alone with a mossy grave from the 19th century, crouching in the shade and pine needles. Beyond the six hours of flying which returned me to the rush and noise of the Orlando airport, life was full of color, and heat. It is a bright world, congested with the hopes and fears of millions, but that is a different kind of brightness from the color of those golden wheat and lentil fields, just harvested, and a different kind of heat from that slow warmth that spread into my eyes as I lay on that hill. Far below the hill of the cemetery, traffic moved along the road like specks in a narrow stream. Who knows where they came from, or where they went? They say you can seek your fortune in the wide world. The wide world is a fine place, I have no doubt, but somehow the world seemed larger, there among the pines. I was a sapling, unaware of the feeling of thick roots pulling into the dirt. I was like the nightshade in the garden, imitating the shape of potato stalks and leaves, yet without potatoes on the thin, bleached roots. But perhaps on that hill, in the midst of those seeds waiting for the resurrection, I began to have some idea of what roots were, and began to feel some thirst for wholesome water. I slowly buried my pretensions under the simple habits of life. Beneath the pine needles, and the young corn, and the brown, shaven hay fields. Beneath the quiet rustling of a dozen prayer books on a summer evening, beneath the slow crunch of feet down a gravel road on the way to the post office, and the taste of sweat in my mouth as I waded through five foot tall grass, stringing barbed wire in the pasture just down state road six. Under the ash of that tiny, rusty, fire pit out back where so many dear friendships formed out of the smoke and moonlight. The romance of the wide world began to seem banal and childish. Habits have a way of changing desires. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Two years later, again it was the last night of Hill Abbey. It had become a tradition among some of us to take a walk down the rail road tracks beside Potlatch on the last night. The tracks receded quickly in front of us in the pale glimmer of our cell phones we held face down for light. Just ahead, the old freight cars marooned at the Potlatch station loomed like black bulls, with their long spines and steel cables like ribs. We clambered up the stubby ladders and sat down on the far side of the rusty beds, stooping like apes to get under the cross beams running down the length of the cars. The peace of the celestial city is the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment of God, and of one another in God, St. Augustine said. We sat there on the dark beds of the freight cars, saying little, not dreaming of the future. We looked up at the sky, at the Milky Way stroking its way across the dark blue, at the slow stirring of the constellations around Polaris, and called the stars after our names.",

    "body": "The summer before I came to college, my dad and I visited Yellowstone National Park. It was a good trip: we tried hiking up Mount Washburn and decided against it a few hundred feet along the trail; we tried Elephant Back mountain instead, and ate lunch at the top looking out over the lake; we drove through the park and remarked sarcastically at the Asian tourists parked on the side of the road taking pictures like they had never seen a buffalo before; we peered out my truck’s windows at giant rocks with snow hidden in the cracks (snow in the summertime—we were from Florida, after all); we waited for half an hour outside Old Faithful, but didn’t have the patience to wait for it to go off. We were good tourists.\n\nI don’t remember Yellowstone that well, though: it’s not the things that postcards say are “experience of a lifetime” that I remember with special fondness or nostalgia.\n\nI remember driving for two and a half hours through the rain—through the twisting, convoluted vortices of the Montana rockies, down an unmarked two lane road which the map called Chief Joseph Scenic Highway—because a rockslide had blocked the east entrance of the park. I remember huddling at night in the blue light of my laptop in the motel with my dad, watching pirated copies of the Harry Potter films with Polish subtitles in somewhat less than standard definition, knowing that I would forever associate the soundtrack of those films with that summer. It was my dad’s first trip through the world of Harry Potter, and I remember mumbling about the death of Dumbledore, in the dark going to sleep, far more than I do the brilliant sunlight and shining lake and deep gorges.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nNostalgia seems to be inextricably connected to a feeling of loss. Nostalgia is a memory of something I want back but don’t have. So looking back on the past, I don’t remember my struggles and immaturities with much nostalgia. I look back on the past, feel nostalgic for what I love and don’t have, measure myself by what I’ve lost, come up short.\n\nI remember when I first read the _Rule of St. Benedict._ I was a junior in high school, sitting curled up beneath a lamp early on a summer morning, inspired. The next day—no, later on that afternoon, in fact—I began working out the sequence of Psalms that St. Benedict prescribed in the _Rule_, and how to get through them once a week, along with the other prayers that he said made up the monks’ service. I think I began to pray seriously for the first time in my life.\n\nI remember the first time I watched _The Island,_ a strange and wonderful Russian independent film about a Russian sailor in WWII, forced by the Germans to shoot his captain, rescued from the wreck of his ship by the monks of a monastery in the North Sea, who spends his life trying to find redemption for his sins. I don’t remember any specific element in the film that stood out to me—a film critic would be disappointed—but I do remember the way the couch felt, leather cold and smooth. I remember the way the room smelled, and the sound of the sprinklers outside through the open windows. I remember going outside afterwards, and sitting on the fence beside the hayfield, looking up at the stars, and thinking of how bad I was at praying.\n\nI’m sure I’m very different now than I was then. Hopefully I’ve improved. It’s been three years. But looking back I don’t think how I’ve grown, how I’ve improved; I only think of how I wish I could feel that excitement and joy again. Like I said, I often feel like I fall short of the past. Maybe it’s just lack of faith.\n\nAfter all, I know that one day I will look back on my life now, on my thirty hour work weeks on top of school, on long nights sitting at desk scribbling away by candlelight, on going for weeks without seeming to grasp the basic principles of Latin poetry, on roommates pouring foul smelling perfume all over my pillow as a prank, on learning to drive in the snow, on failing a history abstract because I forgot to double space it, on coming home for Christmas to my mom’s cooking, on long summer days sitting at my computer working, on the love and joy that comes from friends, and be filled with nostalgia. I’ll look back on my life now, and think of these as some of the best times of my life.\n\nTomorrow will be born a new day, with new aspirations, new memories, but with the past in its soul. What I am doing now will be a subject of memory, introversion, recollection, and judgement. \n\nOne school of thought says that life is short, too short to worry about the past and seek forgiveness for our sins. But the great saints have always said life is too short to focus on the present: the present only lasts for a moment, but the consequences of our pasts and our repentance last forever.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAt the top of Elephant Back mountain, trees rolled into trees below, until the green of the forest turned into the blue of the lake. Sitting on a rock, my dad and I ate our lunches and watched the boats creeping like tiny white insects on the lake.  After forty-five minutes or so we started to come back down, down between the trees, to a future I would one day live, to memories I would one day remember. Our knees hurt by the time we got to the bottom.",

    "created_at": "Wed, 27 Jan 2016 06:27:48 +0000",
    "body": "In Lewis Thomas's Essay, _An Earnest Proposal,  _he writes, \"I take it on faith that computers, although lacking souls, are possessed of a kind of intelligence.\"  I note two points: firstly, that Thomas takes this assertion on faith, and secondly, that he separates intelligence from the soul. These two points are connected.  We perceive the world around us through metaphor, expressing and describing our experience through comparison.  We attribute theological, religious characteristics to the metaphors we choose. Today, technology is our metaphor.  Modernity defines itself by technological advancement.  Industry and philosophical enlightenment go hand in hand.  The economic conflict between the western hemisphere and the \"Third World\" is largely a difference in technology.  The War Between the States here in America was painted by northern abolitionists as a conflict between southern \"backwardness\" and northern \"enlightenment,\" where backwardness was defined by a deeply rooted distrust of theological and economic industrialism. I am making sweeping assertions.  But I am not trying to explain modernity, or to offer a stiff model into which the modern world fits.  I am simply making observations of a specific phenomenon, which is not in doubt: we perceive our own culture, and measure our own culture, through the metaphor of technology. Assertions to the side, I ask that we interrogate Thomas' claim, that computers can be intelligent without souls, through a recognition that we tend to understand \"intelligence\" in almost purely technological terms.  Nicholas Carr in _The Shallows_ notes that we tend to think of our brains like computers, simply because of the pervasiveness of computers in modern society.  Elsewhere on this blog I have mentioned how Joseph Weizenbaum, the great computer scientist, wrote of how computers generate their own metaphorical narrative--that they are \"necessary\"--based on their claim to be a universal machine.  By the adoption of that narrative, we then interpret the rest of the world based on its applicability to the computer.  On the subject of intelligence, therefore, I submit that it has become natural for us, as moderns, to think of intelligence in computational terms: so much information in, so much time in the processing unit, so much information out.  Under this assumption, Thomas' statement is a tautology. Of course it has not always been this way.  The very word _intelligence_ has its roots in the Latin _intellegere,_ meaning to understand, and assimilate.  The Latin itself has its roots in _legere,_ to draw together, to extract.  At least in a older understanding, therefore, intelligence necessitates prudence, and volition: choosing between the good and the bad, assimilating the good together into a unity, connecting individual ideas into a whole.  For the medieval, moreover, an integral part of prudence (and thereby, intelligence or understanding) was _ars memoria,_ the constructing of images and the systemization of the governing metaphors by which material is assimilated and understood.  Intelligence did not merely require a soul, it was a faculty of the soul. But there is another facet to this adoption of modernity's technological narrative, indicated by Thomas' frank admission that he takes the computational metaphor \"on faith.\"  Ian Bogost, a professor of interactive computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has [written](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-cathedral-of-computation/384300/) compellingly in _The Atlantic_ on our faith in computers, so compellingly that I will quote him at length.\n\n> Here’s an exercise: The next time you hear someone talking about algorithms, replace the term with “God” and ask yourself if the meaning changes. Our supposedly algorithmic culture is not a material phenomenon so much as a devotional one, a supplication made to the computers people have allowed to replace gods in their minds, even as they simultaneously claim that science has made us impervious to religion. It’s part of a larger trend. The scientific revolution was meant to challenge tradition and faith, particularly a faith in religious superstition. But today, Enlightenment ideas like reason and science are beginning to flip into their opposites. Science and technology have become so pervasive and distorted, they have turned into a new type of theology.\n\nThis is not a new trend.  Frances Yates wrote years ago in her book, _The Rosicrucian Enlightenment,_ on the hermetic and occultic tendencies within the 16th century origins of the Royal Society.  Humans are religious beings, and whenever a culture adopts a pervasive metaphor, or narrative by which they measure the world, it quickly adopts a religious character. Marxism is a narrative of history, by which history is measured in terms of class struggle; no one can doubt the religious fervor with which advocates of Marxism applied their beliefs.  Capitalism has done the same for some elements of contemporary American conservatism.  The worship of Reason, as a divine force, was made explicit in the French Revolution.  The list of examples could go on. I am not inherently blaiming Lewis Thomas for his adoption of modernity's technological, and computational, narrative.  But I would ask that we take care to discern how many common arguments are actually faux tautologies based on our shared metaphor for the world.  \"Duh\" moments are the most dangerous in rational thought, because we fail to notice their underlying assumptions.",

    "body": "> For the mind, stupefied by bodily sensations and enticed out of itself by sensuous forms, has forgotten what it was, and, because it does not remember that it was anything different, believes that it is nothing except what is seen. --Hugh of St. Victor, _Didascalion, _I. i\n\nThe first several chapters of Hugh of St. Victor's _Didascalion,_ while not themselves dealing directly with the art of memory, present the medieval process of education and thought with equisite clarity.  This process is at the heart of how a mnemonic method--the method of recollection through imaginative figures and _loci_\\--could be for the medieval student not only a technique for remembering ideas, but also a means of shaping the very ideas he remembers. Hugh begins his first chapter by presenting what he--standing in the Augustinian tradition--saw as the principle problem of philosophy.  Philosophy, as he says later on (I. iv), can be defined as the \"discipline which investigates comprehensively (_plene_) the ideas of all things, human and divine (_omnium rerum humanarum atque divinarum rationes_).\"  Or more simply put, as he says at the beginning, the \"love and pursuit of Wisdom.\"   What is the point of this pursuit?  \"Wisdom illuminates man so that he may recognize himself (_seipsum agnoscat_),\" he says (I. i). Echoing Plato, Hugh says that the task of philosophy--indeed, of theology, as we notice Hugh's identification of wisdom (_sapientia_) with the second person of the Trinity--is one of recollection.  When man fell into sin, he forgot his origin, his supernatural identity, a part of his _ratio.  _On the other hand, the proper recollection of man's identity is at the heart of the remedy for man's defect. But in his process of recollection, far from presenting a simple means of remembering or learning, Hugh brings together the physical and metaphysical.  The universe is made up, Hugh says quoting the _Timaeus,_ by the mixture of the \"same\" and the \"diverse\" (_itemque eadem et diversa_).  The human mind is a microcosm of the universe in that it is fitted together out of \"every substance and nature\" (_ex omni substantia atque natura_).  What does it mean for an idea to be contained in the mind?  Or, what is essentially the same, to remember an idea? The soul consists of \"all natures,\" not, of course, physically (_secundem compositionem_), but analogously, or according to the ideas and patterns reflected in the physical forms (_secundem compositionis rationem_).  The mind is imprinted with the \"likenesses\" of all things (_rerum omnium similitudine_), and by such likenesses contains the very things themselves, potentially (_potentialiter_).  The similarity with the figures and _imagines_ of the _ars memoriae_ is instantly obvious. This ability to contain the forms of things, and to organize and reason about such recollection, is what makes man unique.  Hugh says that animals can retain images of sense-perceived forms, but in a \"confused and unclear manner\" (I. iii) and unlike man, \"having once forgotten them, they are unable to recollect or re-evoke them.\"  Man can also remember the forms of things, likenesses of sense-perceived things impressed into the mind, but unlike the animals man can \"not only take in sense impressions which are perfect and well founded, but by a complete act of the understanding _(plenu actu intelligentiae_), explain and confirm what imagination has only suggested.\" For Hugh, then, sin is a failure of memory, a failure to remember the way the world really is, who humans really are in their nature.  Recollection has a theological purpose, for in remembering we do not merely recall facts into our head for further thought, but we experience the real, living, forms of things which we have impressed into our minds.  It is not hard to see what biblical admonishments to tie scriptures \"about your neck,\" and \"bind them continually upon thine heart\" would mean in such a context.  To recollect, to experience \"all natures and substances\" which are contained in the human soul, is a part of prayer and worship, and vice versa. With this understanding, we can see what the \"pursuit of wisdom\" meant for Hugh.  The pursuit of wisdom, the process of recollection, is the means by which man is restored.  \"We are restored through instruction (_reparamur autem per doctrinam_), so that we may recognize our nature and learn not to seek outside ourselves what we can find within.\" In the highest theological sense, if man is made in the _image_ of God, then in the recollection of man's true nature we meet in some sense a part of God's nature, in the same manner that the soul contains \"all natures\" _secundem compositionis rationem._  \"The highest curative in life,\" Hugh says at the end of his first chapter, \"is the pursuit of wisdom (_studium sapientiae_): he who finds it is happy, and he who possesses it, blessed.\"",

    "title": "Art That Speaks: Mary Carruthers' The Craft of Thought",
    "created_at": "Sun, 03 Jul 2016 03:22:27 +0000",
    "body": "The medieval aesthetic—and imagination, and memory—was intimately tied up with the process of communication between the aesthetic object, or the memory image, and the person viewing (or ‘remembering’) it.  Works of art are works of memory and rhetoric, because they enter into the meditative experience of the viewer, and ‘speak’ with him.\n\nMary Carruthers frames this in terms of comparison with the contemporary experience of interacting with art:\n\n> There is a critical difference between modern and early medieval ekphrases, which goes to the heart (or rather the gist) of medieval aesthetic. One of the best-known examples in English of a modern ekphrasis is John Keat’s poem _Ode on a Grecian Urn._ Keat’s urn, you recall, has almost nothing to say for itself. It displays its mute pictures to the admiring poet, but he is entirely on his own to make sense of them; even his guesses about their narrative are uninformed by any assurance from the urn. What little the urn does say is Delphic in its brevity and enigma. Indeed its speech is so puzzling that there is not even agreement among scholars about which words it speaks. As an orator, the artifact shares nothing with its audience; no common social ground, no story is shared by urn and admirer. It is only an object; he is only a subject. In our century, indeed, the urn’s isolated objectivity has been extended to an ideal of poetry that is palpable and mute, having nothing to say to any reader.\n> \n> _\\--The Craft of Thought,_ 223\n\nTo the modern mind, works of art do not speak to the viewer, but instead are objects to which the viewer brings his own subjective experience. Our experience of the art is not an experience which the art gives us, but is instead an experience which we create in ourselves in response to the art. This, I believe, is the most meaningful sense in which we can say that our modern perception of art is ‘relative.’ \n\nThere is much talk about whether the visual arts, or music, or literature is “subjective,” or “objective,” particularly in conservative schools of thought today. This question is typically framed in terms of whether the art _itself_ is subjective, or objective its meaning. But the question can be framed more helpfully by asking _where_ we think the meaning resides. Does the meaning of a work of art reside “in” in the work of art, or “in” the feelings produced by my experience of it, or (as we must also ask) is this even a useful way to ask the question?\n\nIt is not my purpose here to propose an answer to this question. But Carruthers' comments on the medieval experience of art (and memory) are thought provoking. On the one hand, art was a kind of ekphrasis, a description that existed for the purpose of interpretation. Art was, in a word, rhetoric. It spoke to the reader, or viewer, or (for that matter), listener. Art was fundamentally a social event, with a speaker, and an audience (in contrast to the urn, above, which was “only an object,” and its viewer, “only a subject”). But the speaker was not necessarily the artist, as we might think.\n\nCarruthers notes that “each work is a composition articulated within particular rhetorical situations of particular communities,” and applies this idea to the debates over icons between Suger of St. Denis and Bernard of Clairvaux. Both were builders of monastic churches, yet Suger was building a sumptuous church for the royal court, but Bernard for ascetics who had turned back from the world into the “desert.” Was the meaning of each church “in” the church? Or was it “in” the experience of the arbitrary onlooker? Perhaps we might better phrase it by saying that the meaning of the church, just as the meaning of any other piece of rhetoric, was in the _relationship_ between the speaker (the church) and the intended audience (the monks).\n\nFor the modern, the meaning of a work of art is tied to my experience of it, the aesthetic object. But as we have seen, it would be a mistake to say that the medieval was more “objective,” and placed the meaning of the aesthetic object in the object itself. The distinction between the modern and the medieval lies in the medieval’s perception of art as a piece of rhetoric, whose meaning is derived from the dual responsibilities of rhetor and audience. For the modern, I speak in response to the art, and any rhetorical situation is created within my own experience. For the medieval, art speaks, I listen, and in this dual action, the meaning of the art is revealed.\n\nThis is how the art of memory (from ancient times a part of rhetoric) was tied to the process of invention. Creativity, the creation of new meaning and imagination, was not something which happens purely inside myself, but is spawned out of my _interaction_ with the memory image, or piece of art. Because of course, as we can now see, we really mean the same thing by ‘art’ and ‘image.’ Works of art were memory images, and vice versa. Creation comes not from the lone artist, breathing new content out of his ‘imagination’ (in our modern sense), but from the rhetorical situation of the student (the audience) responding to the speaker (his memory images).\n\nTo conclude, we can apply Carruthers' insight of memory (and art) as rhetoric to an example she brings in from Peter of Celle:\n\n> Peter of Celle takes on the iconoclasts’ objection in this treatise, after he has ‘painted’ his many pictures in the text. God prohibited the making of statues (Deuteronomy 5:8), as the iconoclasts have pointed out. But Peter interprets this stricture ethically as referring to the cognitive _uses_ of painting. We can paint pictures and make statues for ourselves to use in contemplation so long as we are not sidetracked into error by that failure of imagination which is also, as we have seen, a weakness of _memoria_, namely _curiositas_ and ‘fornications.’ We should use images painted in fantasy for contemplative thinking; but be careful, Peter says, not to paint upon the tablet of the inward imagination those worldly or morally objectionable or vain details which we might have observed in actual statues of stone or wood, out of a misplaced desire to remember on each occasion every detail of what we actually saw.\n> \n> \\--_The Craft of Thought, _209\n\nAs we can see, for Peter, the ethical value of the image is not inherent either in the image itself, or even in our subjective experience of the image, but in _what_ we create as a result.  To miss the point of the image, to be a distracted audience, because we engage with vain curiosities--that is what Deuteronomy seeks to prohibit.  To phrase the point in the terms of which Carruthers speaks of Keats' poem above, the ethical value of the image is framed in \"the story shared by urn and admirer.\"",

    "body": "[\"Poetry and the Silencing of Art\"](http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Poetry---the-silencing-of-art-4691) by Hilton Kramer in the _New Criterion,_ recently dug up from 1993 on the _New Criterion's _Twitter, is a helpful article about tendencies in contemporary poetry I've been thinking about for a while. I have two observations.\n\nFirstly, the book, which the article describes by a certain Dana Gioia, has an excellent point: that poetry has been enervated by a subculture of its own creation. It doesn't speak to everyday people anymore, the failure of most of the talk of the universities. He wisely observes, \"The modern movement, which began this century in bohemia, is now ending it in the university, an institution dedicated at least as much to the specialization of knowledge as to its propagation. Ultimately the mission of the university has little to do with the mission of the arts, and this long cohabitation has had an enervating effect on all the arts but especially on poetry and music.\"\n\nSecondly, the end of the article dismisses popular culture and its effect on the heart and the mind with, I think, too much readiness: \"High culture cannot compete with its lethal effects on the minds and bodies of the young—and not only the young, of course—and neither can serious education, not as it is now conducted, anyway. And as long as the juggernaut of pop culture continues to swamp everything in its path, not only will poetry remain confined “to the private world that is the poet’s mind” but so will all of high art—whatever remains of it —be confined to the private world of its subculture.\"\n\nMuch of popular culture, no doubt, hurts the cause of high art, and the souls of those who absorb themselves in it with the wrong motivations.  But I do not believe one can safely ignore the simple fact that people turn to much in popular culture, as resonating with their actual experience, in a way which they do not and cannot turn to 'high art'.  As long as poetry remains absorbed in its own high and academic subculture, it will fail to speak to individual lives in the same powerful way of the best of 'popular music.'\n\nI would propose a question to contemporary poetry: why do most people identify with the sentiments of the better sort of our popular singers and musicians, far more than they do with the subculture of written poetry?",

    "created_at": "Sat, 12 Aug 2017 18:44:49 +0000",
    "body": "_Firstly, an aside.  I have not posted here in many months; in fact, I believe the last time I posted here with any kind of regularity is when I began an ill-fated project to blog my way through some potential thesis research on medieval memory techniques and their influence on medieval interpretation of scripture.  Since then the visicitudes of life have occasioned my flight from the groves of academia to seek my fortune in the wide world, where I met with some fortune, some misfortune, and became engaged to be married, among other things, before I returned very recently to the embrace of books, quiet morning tea, lectures, long evenings with Plato and bourbon, drizzly Moscow afternoons, and the other pleasures of an academic life.  Now that I am provided with a bit more leisure for literary pursuits, I hope to post here more often, but if my adventures in the world have taught me anything, it is to make few promises._\n\n* * *\n\nFrédéric Bastiat's _The Law_, seeks to provide a definition and a role for the law and the legislator.  He begins by asserting the classical definitions of man and of justice received from the Enlightenment, that \"Existence, faculties, assimilation--in other words, personality, liberty, property--this is man.\"  Law, he says, was created for the preservation of man, that is, these rights: \"it is the collective organization of the individual right to lawful defense.\" The law, however, has been perverted through two causes, \"naked greed and misconceived philanthropy\"; greed, the natural tendency of legislators to use the force of law to plunder the lawfully earned goods of more industrious men; philanthropy, the misguided use of the force of law to enforce virtue and industry among the naturally lazy and dissipated populace.  Both of these causes lead to what Bastiat classifies as _plunder_, defined as \"when a portion of wealth passes out of the hands of him who has acquired it, without his consent, and without compensation, to him who has not created it, whether by force or by artifice.\" Basiat then proceeds to spend the majority of the central section of his work examining why it is inappropriate to use the law for philanthropic ends.\n\n> The Socialists say, since the law organizes justice, why should it not organize labor, instruction, and religion? Why?  Because it could not organize labor, instruction, and religion, without disorganizing justice. For remember, that law is force, and that consequently the domain of the law cannot propertly extend beyond the domain of force. When law and force keep a man within the bounds of justice, they impose nothing upon him but a mere negation.  They only oblige him to abstain from doing harm ... But when the law, through the medium of its necessary agent--force--imposes a form of labor, a method or a subject of instruction, a creed, or a worship, it is no longer negative; it acts positively upon men.  It substitutes the will of the legislator for their own will, the initiative of the legislator for their own initiative.\n\nThis is the crucial distinction between postive and negative law that separates Bastiat's plan from that of the socialists.  The purpose of the law, argues Bastiat, is merely to prevent injustice, and not to force justice, for, as he later says, _justice_, strictly speaking, does not exist; it is simply the absense of injustice, and it is this absense of injustice which is the legislator's duty to enforce.  Note that it is difficult to imagine any philosopher prior to the Enlightenment defining justice in such a way.  \"What is law?\" asks Bastiat.  \"Law is common force organized to prevent injustice;--in short, Law is Justice.\" The second distinction, which I find rather striking, is his denomination of what is within and without the \"domain of force.\"  Labor, instruction, religion: all these things stand outside the domain of force, that is, of justice.  For justice, as he defined at the very beginning of the work, is the preservation of the essential attributes of man: personality, liberty, and property.  Justice for Bastiat is not a standard which should be applied to every area, that is, justice with respect to religion, or justice with respect to labor, but rather a limited sphere devoted solely to the preservation of liberty. Bastiat puts a great deal of faith in human nature:\n\n> Law is justice. And it is under the law of justice, under the reign of right, under the influence of liberty, security, stability, and responsibility, that every man will attain to the fullness of his worth, to all the dignity of his being, and that mankind will accomplish with order and with calmness--slowly, it is true, but with certainty--the progress ordained for it. I believe that my theory is correct; for whatever be the question upon which I am arguing, wether it be religious, philsophical, political, or economical; whether it affects well-being, morality, equality, right, justice, progress, responsibility, property, labor, exchange, capital, wages, taxes, population, credit, or Government; at whatever point of the scientific horizon I start from, I invariably come to the same thing--the solution of the social problem is in liberty.\n\nBastiat, writing in the first half of the 19th century, looks to America as the great example of liberty's success, though he warns of slavery and tariffs as America's two great violations of the principles of liberty he sets forth, liable to break apart the union: a remarkably prescient observation. One could argue that America's societal decline is due to the increasing lack of the liberty which Bastiat advocates, but it seems that the lack of liberty has followed on the heals of moral dissipation, rather than the way round.  For example, Theodore Roosevelt greatly expanded the force of government over the economic sphere, yet he saw this as necessary due to the avarice and trusts and monopolies, the abuses of workers, and the moral dissipation that had already rotted through the heart of America's labor.  It would not seem that liberty, in this case, quite led to man's attaining the \"fullness of his worth,\" and \"all the dignity of his being.\"  The history of America is a history of decline, and the historical ordering of events seem to dictate that we look elsewhere from political structure for the source of that decline. Liberty, at the end of the day, must be liberty to _do_ something.  Bastiat seems to take it for granted that man's natural tendency is to climb ever higher in order, peace, and prosperity, an assumption worth at least a second glance given the examples of history.",

    "title": "Coercion and the Christian: Finding the Righteous Magistrate In the Political Thought of Augustine",
    "created_at": "Sun, 31 Dec 2017 21:16:52 +0000",
    "body": "Augustine certainly takes a dim view of the civic government of the earthly city, describing it as he does in _The City of God_ as, despite being the “mistress of the nations,” itself “ruled by its lust of rule.” The civic state and its coercion is a product of the Fall, since without original sin, there would have been no need for force. Political authorities are often forced to do things which normally they would consider evil, such as torturing innocent victims to discover doubtful truth. Perhaps a natural response to this realism and cynicism Augustine has about the role of the state in the world would be to conclude that the Christian ruler himself necessarily has to engage in sin in order to fulfill his duties within the state. In fact, given what Augustine says about the earthly city, is there anything about how a Christian would occupy a position of political authority that would mark him out as a specifically “godly” ruler at all? \n\nIt is my task in this paper to demonstrate that there is, in fact, despite Augustine’s belief that the civic state in its coercive role is a result of the Fall, such a thing for Augustine as a specifically Christian sort of ruler who exerts the coercive power of the state to the glory of God without sinning in doing so, and additionally, to enumerate some of the chief characteristics of the godly ruler. There are two areas of Augustine’s thought which are particularly relevant here. Augustine in several places in his writings speaks of the nature of civic polity before the Fall, from which we can discern the characteristics and goals of the righteous man in a position of political authority. We can also draw a helpful comparison with Augustine’s writings on just war, since they show us his perspective on how the righteous should relate to the use of coercion to restrain the wicked.\n\nFirstly, however, we must make an important distinction between the state, as such, and the “earthly city,” as described by Augustine. Frederic Loetscher argues convincingly that by the _civitas terrena_ Augustine means not “the state,” as it has sometimes been translated, but rather the “city of the impious.” Examine Augustine’s treatment of Cicero’s definition of the state—that a true republic exists only when it is rightly and justly governed—in _City of God_ 2.21: by this definition, Rome was never a state at all, since it was never justly governed. Rome was the prime example, for Augustine, of the earthly city, the city of the impious. Many have taken the latter facts as examples of Augustine’s exclusion of the state, (and by extension, we can assume, the office of the ruler himself) from any ethical justification for its existence. But Loetscher argues that Augustine uses this exclusion of Rome from Cicero’s definition of the state as a _reductio_ for that definition, since Augustine himself goes on to define the state as “an assemblage of of reasonable beings bound together by a common agreement as to the objects of their love.”\n\nWhat does this distinction between the state as a civic institution, and the “earthly city” as the society of the impious insofar as they act against the will of God, mean for our search for the godly ruler in Augustine’s thought? It means that the magistrate, insofar as he occupies a position of authority in the state, is not necessarily a member of the earthly city, or acting contrary to God’s law. As we shall see, insofar as he is in authority, he occupies a place which would have been necessary whether or not man had sinned. It is the evil of the rulers of Rome which marked them out as members of the earthly city, and not their status as rulers.\n\nIn several important writings, Augustine talks about the the shape of civic polity if the Fall had not taken place, from which we can discern the character of the righteous ruler. Were it not for the sin of greedy, wicked rulers, “all kingdoms would have been small, rejoicing in neighborly concord; and thus there would have been very many kingdoms of nations in the world, as there are very many houses of citizens in a city.” These kingdoms, moreover, would not have been ruled with political authority based on coercion, but with the paternal authority of the patriarchs. The characteristics of the righteous patriarchs ought to inform the Christian ruler now, after the Fall: in a letter to Marcellinus, Augustine speaks of the state as an enlarged family, language reminiscent of the previously quoted passages about the small, familial polities that would have existed if sin had not created the need for political authority and coercion. The righteous ruler is to exercise the duties of a “pious father,” and rules, “not from a love of power” (for power, in this sense, the _libido dominandi,_ is a result of the Fall), but “from a sense of the duty they owe for others.” The just judge is not proud of his authority, but loves mercy.\n\nHowever, in this fallen world, the magistrate, Christian or not, must exert coercive force as a result of sin. In our search for the character of the Christian ruler, we must ask how Augustine reconciles his previous description of what the Christian ruler should be, with his clear statements regarding the necessity of coercion. A useful parallel can be drawn here between just war and just government. War, made necessary by sin, is undertaken in order to restrain evildoers, just as the coercive power of the state is sometimes necessary to be borne by righteous men in order to restrain the wicked. John Langan argues that for Augustine, an essential element in the justification for war is the preservation and restoration of God’s order in the world. The righteous war is one that is undertaken in obedience to God.  This is an important argument, because it connects the use of coercion in Augustine’s thought (in this case military, but the argument applies also to political coercion) to some positive end, rather than merely a force of necessity.\n\nIn a letter to Boniface, Augustine instructs that he “must not think that no one who serves as a soldier, using arms for warfare, can be acceptable to God.” He goes on to enumerate a number of soldiers in the Bible who were pleasing to God. War is waged for an end, to bring peace, not only to the world, but even “to those whom you defeat.” Political coercion, being directed towards the same end, and necessary for the same reason, can be viewed similarly. I must stress that for Augustine coercion, while an effect of the Fall, is not something that exists outside of God’s grace and will for his people in this present, fallen age. In other words, the way in which the Christian magistrate exercises coercion is not simply the same as the way in which a non-Christian magistrate does it, simply with more internal remorse for the cruel necessity of it all. \n\nAs John R. Bowlin argues, “politics for Augustine is never autonomous,” and that “without an infusion of grace these ordinary realities of political life will be put to use for the sake of ends that fall short of the good and the just.” Bowlin’s use of the word “autonomous” is clarifying here: if the Christian magistrate does not use coercion in a specifically Christian way, if it is not “transformed by grace” as he puts it, then it will be “transformed by vice.” The Christian ruler should exercise gentleness, although he has a duty to “give a cutting edge to the investigation in order to bring outrage to light.” \n\nWhy is this important for our original thesis, that there is for Augustine such a thing as a specifically Christian way to fill the necessary office of the magistracy? The fact that Augustine spends time in his letters speaking of how Christians in authority should use their power, and uses the scriptural language of good works, and displaying God’s mercy to the nations, clearly communicates that the coercive force of political authority is for Augustine not a purely secular result of the Fall, at best to simply be borne by Christians. Instead, the the office of a ruler is fraught with significance. The righteous ruler is to use his authority as a tool to advance God’s will in the world. He is to be merciful, acting as a pious father, taking his example from the patriarchs in the way in which he looks to provide peace to his people and restrain the wicked. The end of the righteous use of political authority is positive good, and insofar he fulfills this duty, the Christian magistrate is a member of, and advances the cause of, the city of God.\n\n_References_:\n\nBowlin, John R. “Augustine on Justifying Coercion.” _The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics_ 17 (1997): 49-70.\n\nLangan, John. “The Elements of St. Augustine's Just War Theory.” _The Journal of Religious Ethics_ 12, no. 1 (1984): 19-38.\n\nLoetscher, Frederick William. “St. Augustine's Conception of the State.” _Church History_ 4, no. 1 (1935): 16-42.",

Give your protagonist, your I-character, something to do.  It's fine to be privy to all of I's ruminations and cerebral nuances, but consciousness can only take us so far in the illumination of character  Particularly if you are writing a memoir piece, with chronology and narrative, it is often liberating to have the I-character step beyond the observer role and be implicated crucially in the over-all action.  How many memoirs suffer from a self-righteous setup: the writer telling a story in which Mr. or Ms. I is the passive recipient of the world's cruelty or is exposed to racism or betrayal, say.  There is something off-putting about a nonfiction story in which the I is infinitely more sinned against than sinning.  By showing our complicity in the world's stock of sorrow, we convince the reader of our reality and even gain his sympathy.\n\nOr, what makes _Crime and Punishment_ so unnervingly fascinating?",

    "title": "Is Social Media the New Totalitarianism?",
    "created_at": "Fri, 09 Feb 2018 18:40:31 +0000",
    "body": "It is popular to criticize the major social media giants—Google, Facebook, Twitter—for their impact on people’s minds, and the proliferation of unwanted ideologies. Both liberals and conservatives are concerned about the amount of “fake news” gobbled up by gullible social media users ready to be entrapped by clickbait. Facebook has been conducting, ever more publicly since the 2016 election season, a vigorous campaign to screen content for factual reliability. Twitter recently [changed its guidelines for verified users](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16667668/twitter-verification-removal-judge-offline-behavior) to include measurement of offline behavior, so they could have a reason to block users associated with radical right-wing groups. Google has been leading the charge for diversity in the workplace, LGBTQ rights, and very recently along with Facebook implemented in-house [rules for dating](https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-you-still-date-a-co-worker-well-its-complicated-1517913001) in order to support the #MeToo campaign. Nevertheless, the tech giants continue to attract international scrutiny and criticism. Just in the past few days, Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [warned Facebook](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/02/08/trudeau-to-facebook-fix-your-fake-news-problem-or-else.html) that unless it fixes its “fake news” problems soon, it will face direct government regulation from Ottawa. But others have identified what they believe is a deeper problem with the very nature of global social networks. A few weeks ago, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, George Soros [stated](https://www.georgesoros.com/2018/01/25/remarks-delivered-at-the-world-economic-forum/) that he believed the behavior of the giant tech companies, like Facebook and Google, was “monopolistic,” and dominating the distribution of information in society. Not only were they suffocating public discourse, he argued, but they encouraged patterns of addiction in their users, and “are inducing people to give up their autonomy.” Without the freedom of mind enabled by the free distribution of ideas, people are easily manipulated, and Soros sees in the near future an alliance between such data monopolies and authoritarian states, resulting in “a web of totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined.” Ironically, Soros’s proposed solution to assuage such fears was increased government regulation over the content distributed by the social media giants, which [John Cassidy in _The New Yorker_](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-george-soros-upstaged-donald-trump-at-davos), rightly I believe, identifies as “optimistic,” at the very least. I fear that it would be glib to simply respond that in a free market, people are free to choose their means of disseminating information, and that the current market has overwhelmingly chosen three companies to do so. Soros has a point: Facebook, Twitter, and Google have made the dissemination of lies easier than ever before in human history. Every media source in the past has been liable to government censorship and manipulation; why should we not fear such control now? I have two simple observations. Firstly, the proliferation of fake news is not a problem created by the social media giants themselves, but simply a fact of human corruption. The faster words move, the faster lies move. When the printing press was invented, all of Europe could spread information faster and more efficiently than ever before, and [with it came lies, rumors, fake scandals, and libel of all sorts.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/fake-news-history-long-violent-214535) Ironically, this presented more challenges to authoritarian states than at any previous point in history, as the printing press enabled the Protestant Reformation, and the later Enlightenment, to rapidly propagate their ideas across western civilization, quickly sparking massive political restructuring, and previously unknown individual freedoms. Secondly, we need to make sure we are asking the right questions when we judge the value of Facebook, Twitter, and Google as distributors of information. The social media giants themselves would like to see themselves as passive, unbiased platforms which other people use to spread information. Concerned social commentators like Soros want us to simply accept their status as the new public square, and subject them to public regulation accordingly. At the end of the day, we are asking a very fundamental question. What is the public square? What is public discourse? And is it the responsibility of the state to maintain the standards or quality of public discourse? I believe most of us would like to say that what _happens_ on Facebook is public discourse, but are we willing to conclude that Facebook then _is_ the new public square? Or is it a private space maintained by Facebook, as we are led to believe by the fact that we have to sign a terms of service agreement with Facebook in order to use the platform? We cannot respond adequately to the criticisms of Soros and others, or accurately measure the cultural effects of social media, until we grapple with these questions.",

    "created_at": "Tue, 20 Feb 2018 04:30:49 +0000",
    "body": "In a [recent article for _The Atlantic_,](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/02/chinas-dangerous-dream-of-urban-control/553097/) Adam Greenfield writes perceptively about the growth of intrusive, government-initiated social technologies in China.  Artificial intelligence, through face-recognition technologies and cameras on every corner, allow the Chinese government almost complete knowledge of the each citizen's actions, and as a result, they want to establish a system of \"social credit,\" through which a citizen is awarded or penalized for how well his life measures up to the official standard.  Take public transit instead of driving and get better insurance rates.  Or perhaps more sinisterly, in order to keep your passport, don't attend Christian worship services. Greenfield points out an interesting philosophical assumption of the Chinese elite that makes such government micro-management palatable:\n\n> As far as the ruling elites of Zhongnanhai are concerned, though, “sincerity construction,” or the process that results in stability and public rectitude, is something far too important to be left to the unplanned interactions of millions of city dwellers. From their point of view, orderliness is paramount, because orderliness makes for stability, and stability makes for continued economic growth. In their 21st-century interpretation of the “[mandate of heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven),” the 3,000-year-old doctrine of Chinese imperial rule, only continued economic growth underwrites continued legitimacy.\n> \n> Seen in this light, order produced from below is not reliable enough to be trusted. It leaves too much room for chance. And worst of all, from the perspective of a party bent on perpetuating its control, it does nothing to prevent the possibility of contagious urban insurrection. Social credit offers a salve to all these concerns.\n\nWhat assumption is hidden under the belief that \"sincerity construction\" is a process far too important to be left to the decisions of individuals?  Namely, that there is something distinct about the power or standards of the community that is more than the sum of the individual.  Order is something that comes from above, because order is a concept external to the nature of man as an individual. Thomas Hobbes and John Locke referred to the state of man in the absense of civil government as the \"state of nature;\" the Chinese elite believe man in the state of nature to be simply instruments of chaos.  It is only in their status as a whole civil community, ruled by the imperial state, that order is possible.  Hobbes also believed that man in the state of nature was in a state of chaos, a state of war, as he called it.  As a result, he was entirely comfortable with man surrendering his rights to the ruler, the absolute state, the Leviathan, as he called the state, and his famous book about its origins and rights.  Hobbes went even further.  Because of man's fundamentally chaotic, pre-moral being when he is in the state of nature, submission to civil authority _requires_ the giving up of man's most fundamental rights. Hobbes defined a covenant between two men, the most basic building block of civilized society, as the giving up of rights which man previously had in the state of nature.  \"The mutural transferring of Right, is that which men call Contract,\" he said (_Leviathan, _I.14). He goes on to define the origins of the commonwealth in an entire community of men giving up their rights to the sovereign.  This sounds remarkably similar to the assumption that Chinese elite make about their citizens.  In order to achieve civil order, they must give up fundamental rights, such as the ability to choose their religion, their livelihoods, or the most basic decisions.  As it turns out, the question of how to limit the government's use of technology turns, as so many questions do, on the nature of man.",

    "created_at": "Thu, 22 Feb 2018 16:37:06 +0000",
    "body": "Rating: 4/5 _[The Ritual](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5638642/?ref_=nv_sr_1)_, a tense, tightly written horror film released a few weeks ago on Netflix, is a beautifully done film, that asks the right questions in a way that keeps the viewer in suspense, and provokes genuine sympathy for its characters. Like perhaps too many horror films, however, I don’t believe that, in the end, it answers fully the central question it asks. It opens with a group of college friends in an English pub, arguing over where to go on vacation. They are opinionated, selfish; the seed of dissension is right beneath their skin. On the way home, Luke (Rafe Spall), the the central character of the story, stops by a liquor store with Rob, another member of the friends, only to discover while they are purchasing vodka that the store is being held up. In the mugging that follows, Rob is repeatedly bashed in the head with a tire iron until he dies, while Luke huddles, afraid, behind a shelf of champagne. For one moment, before the last blow strikes, Rob makes a great effort to look up at the hidden Luke, perhaps accusingly, perhaps imploringly. Ever afterwards, Luke is besieged by guilt, by the fear that if he had acted, confronted the criminals, Rob would never have died. The friends, motivated by the innate human need for ritual, go to Sweden to hike, because that was what Rob wanted to do. On top of a mountain—in a beautifully shot sequence highlighting the forests and fog of Sweden, the alternating brown of the hilly fields, and green of the wooded mountains—they erect an altar of stone, place on it a picture of Rob, say a few, realistically trite, agnostic words, and pour out a libation of vodka in his honor. Someone says the phrase, “it didn’t have to happen.” Luke takes it personally, and his mind is filled by doubt and guilt; he desperately wants Rob’s death not to be his fault, but the guilt and insecurity keep him thinking of almost nothing else. He is quiet, reclusive. This sets up the key drama of the film. Luke must somehow deal with his guilt, and the effect that it has on those around him. The rest of the film—the frantic scurrying through the forested mountains, the monster, symbolizing Luke’s guilt picking off the friends one by one and impaling them on the trees, to the climactic end in which Luke burns down the temple of a group of deranged swedes who worship the forest monster, only to barely escape the monster himself—is well written, keeps the viewer on his toes, and has a lack of gratuitous jump scares to make any thoughtful viewer at least a little appreciative. But in the final quarter of the film—when Dom, Luke’s last remaining friend, is about to be sacrificed, and following—this is where the film seems to leave one of its initial dramatic questions unanswered. Or, at least, not answered in a compelling way. The film is filled with religious imagery, and imagery suggesting man’s need for religion. The friends offer a vague ritual in memorial of Rob on top of a mountain. The parishioners of the fiend are created when travelers are presented with a choice: they must either bow and worship the guilt-fiend—and he is a guilt-fiend, as we are constantly reminded by Luke’s hallucinations of the liquor store whenever the fiend appears—or they will be impaled by the fiend on the trees of his forest. They must bow and worship a demon, or else be hung from a tree. Luke is saved, because at the end, after all his friends are dead, he finally bows and worships, and only then is he allowed to escape the forest. What does this mean? Luke faces his guilt, admits to it in worshipping the fiend. Only in finally admitting to it he is saved. Before he admitted to it, his friends were torn apart, at first figuratively, through arguments—especially a fight between Luke and Dom when Dom accuses him of being a coward, of being responsible for Rob’s death—but after they are all dead, Luke finally admits and confronts his guilt, and is saved. So far, perhaps so good. But this ignores something profound about the nature of guilt. It’s not just through admitting to guilt that one is delivered from it; that’s just the beginning. In the final scene, Luke confronts the monster admits the hallucinated wreckage of the liquor store. We see Rob, dying once again in front of Luke, as he lays on the ground, his head pinned to the dirt by the fiend’s paw. Rob dies, just as before. Luke snatches an axe, strikes the fiend once in the neck, and runs to safety, away from the hallucination that still accuses him. It’s for this reason that as a viewer I feel that the central problem of the film remains unanswered. Luke must return to Dom’s wife, and tell him that he died. Luke must, presumably, still live with the guilt of Rob’s death; he has never done anything in the film to substantively engage with his actions at the liquor store. He is bettered by the experience to be sure; the film is not without merit. He breaks a wrist fruitlessly attempting to save Dom at the end, and we feel proud of him. We see the growth of Luke’s character. We see that at the heart of the answer to guilt is religious fear, and sacrifice. And, perhaps most notably in the horror genre, the characters are all meaningful individuals, who we care about, and suffer a little along with them. It’s a beautifully shot film. It was, at the end, a pleasure to watch. Perhaps I should be happy to find a horror film with which I have only one real qualm. I am happy, in fact. But my remaining qualm is one central to the dramatic question posed by the film. When Luke worships the fiend of his own guilt, runs away from his hallucination, and ends only by standing at the edge of the forest, bathed in the morning sunlight and the fog, screaming with animal ferocity back at the darkness, at the valley of the shadow of death where he was taken to be tested, I feel that his battle with guilt is missing a key weapon, repentance.",

    "created_at": "Tue, 06 Nov 2018 06:15:42 +0000",
    "body": "Robert Epstein, the distinguished American psychologist, [published in May of this year an essay](https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer) arguing, in the words of its subtitle, that “Your brain does not process information, retrieve knowledge, or store memories. In short: your brain is not a computer.” He is arguing against what he calls the “IP” metaphor for the brain — the brain as information processor: this metaphor for the human brain has set back the research of neuroscience, and inhibited our ability to comprehend the real means by which we perceive, remember, and re-experience past realities in order to interpret the present. Yet I would argue that a flippant rejection of the metaphor can lead us far astray—if not in the field of neuroscience, at least in our philosophy of man’s relationship to the computer. I will not summarize the entire article here—it is well worth reading—but I will quote a section.\n\n> “Computers really do operate on symbolic representations of the world. They really store and retrieve. They really process. They really have physical memories. They really are guided in everything they do, without exception, by algorithms. Humans, on the other hand, do not – never did, never will. Given this reality, why do so many scientists talk about our mental life as if we were computers?”\n\nThe idea of the computer is largely rooted in a similarity to the human brain; if not to its internal working, at the very least by external similarity of effect. Both the brain and the computer yield the external appearance of memory, logical thought, and action. As a result, we see in the computer an image of ourselves. Alan Turing’s famous paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” which described the standard for “intelligence” in a machine, that the machine should be able to on an external level replicate the answers of a human witness on a questionnaire, is rooted to some degree in this IP metaphor for the brain. Even if we deny the similarity of internal working, on a physiological level, to ignore the broader, seemingly more important similarity of experience to make computers very dangerous indeed. Put more simply, interacting with a computer is far too much like interacting with a fellow human to let this fact go unnoticed in our analysis. In the passage above, Epstein, despite his learning about the physiological workings of the brain, makes a quite naive statement about the effects of human thought. We, as well as computers, contrary to Epstein, operate on symbolic representations of the world. These symbolic representations may not indeed, as he argues, be stored in the physical neurons of the brain, but nevertheless they exist, at the very least to my own consciousness. I do not directly intuit reality around me, but rather form abstractions from past experience, and reason from these past experiences to interpret the present, and make predictions about the future. Except on the level of the most basic reflexes, I operate on symbolic representations of the world. Language itself is symbolic. Abstract human thought, man’s reason that differentiates him from animals, is inseparable from words. Even in more intuitive thoughts, not yet formed into words, I still base my sensation on symbolic representation. Just as a computer may equate two symbols in a programming language by identifying that they share the same geographical address in its processor’s memory, I can identify two animals as being of the same type by identifying that they share the same conceptual elements with an abstraction of “kitten-ness” in my head (or elsewhere, depending on which side of 14th century metaphysical debates you find most compelling). It is a fallacy to assert a distinction between my own process and that of a computer simply because the computer requires a few more layers of abstraction in order to perform essentially the same tasks as I do. Epstein’s most persuasive moment comes when he asserts that we are not controlled by algorithms, unlike our digital compatriots. His argument appeals to our most fundamental desire for freedom, freedom from a fatalistic system design which we must follow as a result of our brain chemistry. If Epstein delivers us from a reductionistic fatalism based on the IP metaphor for our neurons, then very well. But nevertheless I _am_ guided, if not by algorithms, at the very least by a plan. I act towards an end, and that end, moreover, is outside myself, just as the end of the computer is outside itself, acting at the behest of its programmer. I openly recognize my debt to Aquinas in this objection to Epstein, but it is impossible to develop a coherent theory of man’s relationship to the computer without making some reference to a broader philosophy or theology of human action. I agree with Epstein; we are not controlled by algorithms. We enjoy free will, to act in accordance with our end, or against it. But nevertheless our actions are ordered to an end, the end of our creator, just like those of a computer. Put simply, both humans and computers act on data, whether the symbolic representations of computer memory or more intuitive mental abstractions. To assert the existence of free will rather than algorithms as the motivational force behind that action is a valid distinction between humans and computers, and an important one, but it does nothing to mitigate the fundamental similarity of effect between the free thoughts of a man and the carefully crafted logical conclusions of a computer that Turing so famously argued for in his paper. Drawing this unwarranted connection from the physiological dissimilarity between the human brain and the computer processor and the actual external effects of the computer and the brain can lead us to dangerous conclusions. The computer is a tool created after the image of the human mind, and naively accepting the computer’s claim to human-like action, or perhaps worse, ignoring it, as Epstein seems to do, can lead us to a host of false assumptions about what the computer is capable of. One may perhaps legitimately criticize Turing’s thesis by pointing out its reductionistic theory of human thought. Epstein deserves praise for objecting to that. But to separate human thought and the computer completely requires us to vastly underestimate the effect that the computer has on us through its claim to pseudo-rational action.",

    "title": "Notes on the Imagery of Cain and Abel in Steinbeck’s East of Eden",
    "created_at": "Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:26:59 +0000",
    "body": "_Delivered at New Saint Andrews College to the Lost Generation Literature class, November 6, 2018._ Good morning. First of all, I recognize that Cain and Abel imagery is arguably the most obvious biblical allusion made in the course of the novel, and therefore I will not be spending a great deal of time arguing that such imagery does in fact exist, or analyzing where or in what manner it exists. Rather I will take it for granted that the biblical story of Cain and Abel is the dominant myth lying behind the characters of Adam and Charles, Cal and Aron, and attempt to do some close reading of the passages where this story is referenced, in order to hopefully provide some insight into what this imagery really means for the novel. Cain and Abel, as biblical characters, do not loom reproachfully over the human characters of the novel with a fierce, allegorical symbolism. Rather, the human characters are left free to do as they will, and the story of Cain and Abel is, at various times, referenced explicitly or implicitly in order to provide interpretation and symbolic context. The story of Cain and Abel becomes almost a character in the story through the explicit references of the characters. For example, on page 265 of the Centennial edition which I believe most of us have, Samuel reads the sixteen verses of the story from the Bible which he borrows from Adam, because when they first mention the naming of Adam’s twins, Samuel suggests, half-jokingly, that they be called Cain and Abel, while recognizing that of course they could not; “that would be tempting whatever fate there is,” he says. Samuel, Lee, and Adam go on to meditate on the meaning of the story, with its dark, desolate outlook on man’s condition. More than the story of the Fall, they say, the murder of Abel provides a concrete picture of original sin, of the darkness and wickedness embedded in every human heart, and the guilt that plagues them. Lee declares, “No story has power, nor will it last, unless we feel in ourselves that it is true and true of us. What a great burden of guilt men have!” Every man tries to take the burden of guilt on himself; “We gather our arms full of guilt as though it were precious stuff. It must be that we want it that way.” As the conversation goes on, Samuel points out the seeming fickleness of God in the story:\n\n> ‘Adam was excited. “Yes, but why did God condemn Cain? That’s an injustice.” Samuel said, “There’s an advantage to listening to the words. God did not condemn Cain at all. Even God can have a preference, can’t he? … Cain got mad. His feelings were hurt. And when a man’s feelings are hurt he wants to strike at something, and Abel was in the way of his anger.” Lee said, “St. Paul says to the Hebrews that Abel had faith.” “There’s no reference to it in Genesis,” Samuel said. “No faith or lack of faith. Only a hint of Cain’s temper.”’\n\nFrom this conversation between Samuel, Adam, and Lee, there are three brief observations I would like to make about the usage of the biblical story. Firstly, the story is read in order to shed light on their own feelings about identity, faith, guilt, and family. _East of Eden_, after all, is very much a story about family, starting off as it does with a genealogical essay on the origins of the central characters. Perhaps surprisingly, the characters of the novel are quite well aware of the symbolic story that their own actions reference. Just as though the Fall, witnessed to by the sin of Cain, original guilt is passed down, so _East of Eden_ is a story about the failures of parents, and the sins of children. Arguably, just as the failures of Cathy’s parents contributed to her sociopathy, so did the failures of Adam (both in his naiveté about Cathy in the first place, and later in his almost complete absence from his boys’ lives) contributed to Cal’s guilt at the end. The story of Cain and Abel is not the allegorical parent of Steinbeck’s novel, but rather a foil for many of its characters’ central relationships, with its own unique place in the story. Secondly, the interaction of Samuel with the story emphasizes the need to approach the guilt and sin of the novel without naiveté, with open-eyed acknowledgment of the harsh realities that seems to present itself in God’s providence. Divine history is a history of blood and guilt, along with redemption, and failing to recognize the paradoxes in the Bible and in life can lead only to a glib, uncomforting reconciliation. Steinbeck shows us this in the character of Liza, Samuel’s wife:\n\n> Lee asked, “How does Mrs. Hamilton feel about the paradoxes of the Bible?” \"Why, she does not feel anything because she does not admit they are there.” ‘“But--\" \"Hush, man. Ask her. And you’ll come out of it older but not less confused.” Liza says that we should not attempt to understand, that we should merely accept.\n\nSamuel says of the stories of the Fall and of Cain and Abel: “Two stores have haunted us and followed us from our beginning,” Samuel said. “We carry them along with us like invisible tails—the story of the original sin and the story of Cain and Abel. And I don’t understand either of them. I don’t understand them at all but I feel them. She says I should not try to understand them. She says why should we try to explain a verity.” We ought to try and understand. But we have to start by admitting the truth, which is quite often not a comforting one at all. Thirdly, we should not fail to notice what Lee says of the nature of a good story. When we read it, if it is good, we in some measure feel the truth of it in our hearts. I believe we would be amiss not to see some Steinbeck’s own hopes for his novel in this statement. The guilt of Cain at the murder of Abel, the guilt of Cal at his implicit murder of Aron, and the guilt each of us feels at the burden of sin passed on to us from our ancestors, speaks to us. Finally, in the remaining time left to us, I would like to bring us to Cal and Lee’s conversation at the very end, in which Cal must wrestle with his own guilt, and Lee bardicly attempts to find some explanation for it all, for the generations of death and anger of brother against brother. Lee’s thoughts might well be ours, as readers:\n\n> “I had to find out my stupidities for myself. These were my stupidities: I thought the good are destroyed while the evil survived and prosper. ‘I thought I had inherited both the scars of the fire and the impurities which made the fire necessary — all inherited, I thought. All inherited. Do you feel that way? That isn’t good enough . . . Maybe you’ll come to know that every man in every generation is refired. Does a craftsman, even in his old age, lose his hunger to make a perfect cup—thin, strong, and translucent? . . . Cal, listen to me. Can you think that whatever made us—would stop trying?”\n\nSteinbeck’s is a story of Cain and Abel in which we do not give up on Cain, in which we do not give up on ourselves simply because we are children of Cain. It’s not good enough to simply recount the story of ancestral sins. We must try and understand ourselves, our own guilt, and act, because we have free will, the power to choose. Adam blesses Cal with the word “Timshel,” meaning, as rendered by Steinbeck, “thou mayest.” We are all Cal, having inherited the sins of our fathers, but blessed with the power of choice.",

    "body": "> In every field, from business to politics to marketing to education, the dominant mode of experience has become entertainment.\n> \n> \\-- Michael Crichton\n\nI am surrounded by both beauty and ugliness, but I cannot see either. The bloody stripes of my mind’s constant self-flagellation go without feeling. Constantly I cast about for some diversion that will keep my will from its duty, some intemperance with which I can shroud my intellectual senses, hiding from my certain knowledge that they have left their duties derelict through a complete identification with my basest appetites.\n\nI entertain myself. What does it mean to entertain myself? It is procrastination of the will; that when faced with the difficulty of choosing between good and evil, between all the grains in the great sandstorm of thoughts with which it is constantly besieged, it abdicates all responsibility, and retreats to the temporary peace of pure sensory experience. In pure experience, no choice is necessary, and I can achieve complete passivity. In closing my eyes to the stinging sandstorm, I am at peace, yet I cannot see. Through my soul’s negligence, I have become blind.\n\nBut what is 'myself'? What is this thing which I so dutifully entertain? What is the essential part of my being that I so identify with? Is it my body? Surely not. My body, the instrument of my soul, is merely the physical tool that I express myself with. This is not what I entertain, but merely the chief and principle toy with which I occupy myself. Is it my mind? What, in my mind? Is it my desires for bodily comfort, for warmth, food, or sexual pleasure? What of higher desires, for inner peace, or satisfaction with my situation in life, or composure at my lack of knowledge of the future? Is it this that I entertain? No, of course not, for these things are not my mind, but only the flights of fancy that proceed from it. Ah, this perhaps is the trouble. I am disgusted with the products of my own mind, with its fears, vain desires, and dark dreams, and I foolishly identify the worst parts of myself with my most essential nature.\n\nI say that I hate myself. But I do not truly hate myself. I hate my desires. I am not my desires, but I have blinded myself. Unable to see my true nature, I close my eyes still harder to the terrible choices of existence, and imagine that the sand beating against my closed eyelids is in fact simply myself, the stinging sensation against my face merely the existential pain of existence.\n\n* * *\n\nFar out in the Egyptian desert, an ancient monk sat at the opening of his cave, eating a piece of bread, the crumbs falling softly on his frazzled, white beard. The lilting sound of the wind in the rocks was broken by footsteps. The elderly monk looked up, and saw a much younger man, wrapped in the same humble cloak as himself.\n\n“Only a few short months ago, you committed yourself to a solitary life of prayer,” said the old man.\n\n“I am weak, and sad,” said the young man. “I am ill-suited to a solitary life. I am incapable of prayer, and all the eagerness which I used to have for the spiritual life seems to have vanished. When I kneel to pray, I am besieged by doubt. Most of all I am torn by doubts of my own worth, whether my meager acts of service are any good, tainted as they are by the sins of the flesh.”  \n\nThe old man got up silently, and set his remaining bread on a flat rock ten yards or so from the cave. “Wait with me,” he said, when he returned to the young man.  \n\nAfter an hour, two ravens which had been circling overhead landed near the bread, cawed raucously, and approached the rock.  \n\nThe old man pointed at the ravens. “These ravens are your thoughts. Not merely fleshly temptations, but also thoughts of anger and self-hatred sent to you by the demons to distract you from your great calling. We are your soul, your will, the part of you to which you refer most when you say, ‘myself.’ The ravens are completely external to us. We have observed them flying above our heads in peace. But we chose first to set out food for them, and then to entertain them. Now that they are here, they are much harder to drive away. It is difficult to stop hating yourself, once you have started it. But your self-hatred is external to yourself, like these ravens. Take away their food, cease entertaining them, and they shall depart as easily as they came.”  \n\n“Brother,” said the young man, “what is this food, that I may take it away?”  \n\n“Selfish desire. The belief that you are no more than your desires, and that therefore you must entertain your thoughts as your own children. It is great pride to attribute so much value to your own thoughts. They are only ravens, sent by the devil to devour your sustenance. Empty yourself of such vanities, and be filled with the love of God.”\n\n“I will go,” said the young man. “I will pray, for mercy.”  \n\n“Pray also for me,” said the old man, getting up to drive off the ravens. “For I too am weak, and dependent on the mercy of God.”",

    "body": "“Bodhicitta comprises in it two elements, viz., enlightenment of the nature of essencelessness (_sunyata_) and universal compassion (_karuna_). This definition of Bodhicitta as the perfect comingling of sunyata and karuna had far-reaching effects in the transformation of the Mahayanic ideas into the Tantric ideas. After the production of Bodhicitta the adept becomes a Bodhisattva and proceeds on in an upward march through ten different stages which are called the bodhisattva-bhumis (i.e., the stages  \nof the Bodhisattva).\n\nThe first of these is the stage of Pramudita or the stage of delight or joy. Here the Bodhisattva rises from the cold, self-sufficing and nihilistic conception of Nirvana to a higher spiritual contemplation. The second is styled as the Vimala or the stage free from all defilement. The third is the Prabhakari or that which brightens; in this stage the Bodhisattva attains a clear insight - an intellectual light about the nature of the dharmas. The fourth stage is the Arcismati or ‘full of flames,’ - these flames are the  \nflames of Bodhi which burn to ashes all the passions and ignorance. At this stage the Bodhisattva practises thirty-seven virtues called bodhipaksikas which mature the bodhi to perfection. The next is the Sudurjaya stage or the stage which is almost invincible. This is a stage from which no evil passion or temptation can move the Bodhisattva. The sixth stage is called the Abhimukhi, where the Bodhisattva is almost face to face with prajna or the highest knowledge. The seventh is the Durangama which literally means ‘going far away.’ In this stage the Bodhisattva attains the knowledge of the expedience which will help him in the attainment of salvation. Though he himself abides here by the principles of void and non-duality and desirelessness, yet his compassion for beings keeps him engaged in the activities for the well-being of all the creatures. The eighth is the stage of Acala, which means ‘immovable.’ The next is the Sadhumati or the ‘good will’; when the Bodhisattva reaches such a stage all the sentient beings are benefited by his attainment of the highest perfect knowledge. The tenth or the last is the stage of dharma-megha (literally ‘the clouds of dharma’), where the Bodhisattva attains perfect knowledge, great compassion, love and sympathy for all the sentient beings. When this last stage of Dharma-megha is reached, the aspirer becomes a perfect Bodhisattva or a Buddha.”\n\nQuotation from Shashi Bushan's _Dasgupta, An Introduction to Tantric Buddhism, C_alcutta University Press, 1958, 9-10.\n\n**Summary**\n\n_Pramudita_\n\nJoy\n\n_Vimala_\n\nFreedom from defilement\n\n_Prabhakari_\n\nIntellectual light about the dhmaras\n\n_Arcismati_\n\nFull of the flames which burn all passions and ignorance\n\n_Sudurjaya_\n\nSpiritual invincibility\n\n_Abhimukhi_\n\nFace to face with highest knowledge\n\n_Durangama_\n\nKnowledge of experience; compassion\n\n_Acala_\n\nImmovable (?)\n\n_Sadhumati_\n\n'Good will'; all sentient beings are benefited by the Bodhisattva's attainment of knowledge\n\n_Dhmarma-megha_\n\nAttainment of perfect knowledge, compassion, love, and sympahty for all beings",

    "title": "Thomas Aquinas on the Limits of Human Knowledge",
    "created_at": "Mon, 14 Jan 2019 19:07:33 +0000",
    "body": "_Some Reading Notes_\n\nPerusing the beginning of St. Thomas’ _Summa_ this morning, it struck me how honest Thomas is about the sources of his knowledge, and the nature of the conclusions reachable by human reason. Human knowledge is but a feeble endeavor, and depends finally on a faith as childlike as that of the mystics.  \n\nIn the first article, Thomas addresses why we need theology at all. Man is directed to God, he says, but this direction is beyond the grasp of our reason. We all have an intuition that we are destined to something higher than we can perceive. “Hence it was necessary for the salvation of man that certain truths which exceed human reason should be made known to him by divine revelation.” There is a natural law, natural signs of the nature of God and our relationship to him, but far from being plain and founded upon solid logic, Thomas says that God gave us the scriptures “because the truth about God such as reason could discover, would only be known by a few, and that after a long time, and with the admixture of many errors.” This is not a statement made by a man particularly optimistic about the evangelistic possibilities of apologetics. In reply to the objection that God must be known through reason, in fact, Thomas replies that, “Although those things which are beyond man's knowledge may not be sought for by man through his reason, nevertheless, once they are revealed by God, they must be accepted by faith.” In other words, not only is human reason so insufficient that God _may not_ be sought for by man through only the aid of his reason, the foundation of the science which Thomas seeks to illuminate through the Summa is built finally on _faith_.  \n\nWe are aware of the feebleness of our own knowledge; sacred science provides us with, not the firm result of our reason, but a source of salvation from our reason. Without sacred science we could never reach what Thomas calls “wisdom,” the higher knowledge which sets our reason in order, and only through which our reason can see anything. “This doctrine is wisdom above all human wisdom; not merely in any one order, but absolutely.” The very principles on which sacred science operates are above the understanding of our reason: “Sacred doctrine derives its principles not from any human knowledge, but from the divine knowledge, through which, as through the highest wisdom, all our knowledge is set in order.”  \n\nThis is an example of a distinction that I have found valuable in discussions of apologetics. It is not the task of apologetics, at least insofar as they operate within the limits of human reason that we all, Christian and non-Christian alike, have at our disposal, to demonstrate the “truth” of Christianity, but only its reasonableness. Through apologetics we can show that our belief is not irrational, but not that it is rationally necessary. As Thomas points out later in this section on sacred doctrine, however, no science does this; no science can or tries to prove its first principles.  \n\nThomas himself is one of the greatest of the Church’s doctors, firmly convinced of the truth of the sacred science’s conclusions about God and the world, and yet he is the first to admit, here at the beginning of the greatest of this theological works, that divine truth is virtually unknowable on our own. Only through faith in the person of God, and in his scriptures, can we attain to any real knowledge. But even this knowledge that we attain to through faith is often nowhere near as firm as we hope. The Christian life is full of doubt, fear, and uncertainty. Thomas is perfectly honest about this too. In Article 5 of “On Sacred Doctrine,” he discusses the nobility of theology over the other sciences. The first and principle objection to this noble status for theology is its _uncertainty_. It establishes so little certitude, the objection goes, that it not to be accorded much nobility.  \n\nTo reply to this objection, Thomas establishes an important distinction: the certitude that a particular fact may have in itself, and the certitude that we as fallible humans may have in our knowledge of that certain fact. The claims of scripture are self-evident in themselves, in that they are true, but they are not self-evident to us. Even the existence of God itself, Thomas admits, is not self-evident to us fallible humans, although he believes that the existence of God can be demonstrated from effects. Of this sacred science, Thomas says that “this science surpasses other speculative sciences; in point of greater certitude, because other sciences derive their certitude from the natural light of human reason, which can err; whereas this derives its certitude from the light of divine knowledge, which cannot be misled: in point of the higher worth of its subject-matter because this science treats chiefly of those things which by their sublimity transcend human reason; while other sciences consider only those things which are within reason’s grasp.”  \n\nDespite the uncertainty inherent within religious belief, Thomas nevertheless finds it the most important pursuit we can have: “It may well happen that what is in itself the more certain may seem to us the less certain on account of the weakness of our intelligence, ‘which is dazzled by the clearest objects of nature; as the owl is dazzled by the light of the sun’ (Metaph. ii, lect. i). Hence the fact that some happen to doubt about articles of faith is not due to the uncertain nature of the truths, but to the weakness of human intelligence; yet the slenderest knowledge that may be obtained of the highest things is more desirable than the most certain knowledge obtained of lesser things.”  \n\nThomas goes on from these statements to make some general notes about the methods of this science that is so far above human reason. Since the foundation of Christian belief is faith in a personal God and in his scriptures, it does not seek to prove this foundation, but goes on from this foundation to prove other things. In this way, it is similar to the other sciences: “As other sciences do not argue in proof of their principles, but argue from their principles to demonstrate other truths in these sciences: so this doctrine does not argue in proof of its principles, which are the articles of faith, but from them it goes on to prove something else.” To be clear, Thomas does not believe that human reason is useless—“sacred doctrine makes use even of human reason, not, indeed, to prove faith (for thereby the merit of faith would come to an end), but to make clear other things that are put forward in this doctrine”—but nevertheless believes it to be useless in establishing a foundation for belief.",

So long as this way is not opened up to us we shall also fail to see what instrumentality, which is based on causality, actually is\" (6).\n\nTechnology is finally all about revealing. Technology is a “mode” of revealing.  What is “new” about “modern” technology?  The revealing that rules modern technology is a “challenging,” which requires of nature to bring forth (“presence” as verb) something which “can be extracted and stored as such.”  Heidegger draws a distinction between this “challenging” of nature as opposed to the “setting in order” of nature which the old farmers did in the sense of \"to take care of and to maintain.\"\n\nWhat is \"bringing-forth\"? \"Bringing-forth comes to pass only inso- far as something concealed comes into unconcealment”  (7). “Reavealing” is truth.  The essence of technology is wrapped up in the “revelation” of truth,  \"The possibility of all productive manufacturing lies in revealing” (7).\n\nIt is the _kind_ of revealing that modern technology does that makes it so dangerous. “The revealing that rules throughout modern technology has the character of a setting-upon, in the sense of a challenging-forth\" (9). “Setting upon,” as a translation of the German _stellen.  _I cannot help but think of Uncle Buck in Faulkner’s novel _The Unvaquished_ with his “strange notions” about people belonging to the land, or perhaps of the agrarian writing of Wendell Berry.\n\nBecause it is man who accomplishes this setting upon of nature for the sake of storing-up, man himself is viewed as a part of the “standing reserve” which is modern technology’s object. As a result, the “spirit” of modern technology is something outside of man.  \"We now name that challenging claim which gathers man thither to order the self-revealing as standing-reserve: _Gestell_ or \"Enframing\".  We dare to use this word in a sense that has been thoroughly unfamiliar up to now” (11).\n\nThe “essence” of modern technology is then for Hegel this _Gestell_, or “en-framing,” or, “apparatus-making,” which he defines as “the gathering together of that setting-upon (_stellen)_ which sets upon man to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve.” Basically, then, as I understand it, the essence of “modern\" technology for Heidegger is its seeing or “revealing” of the world as an industrial store or reserve of energy, rather than an organic life-source to be cultivated and lived in.  Perhaps I am reading too much into Heidegger at this point?\n\nThis is connected to human freedom.  Freedom governs the revealed. Original freedom is not immediately connected with the causality of man’s willing, but rather in man’s dwelling in the “realm of destining,” i.e., not a fate which compels.  I quote Heidegger here, but I am deeply confused as to how “not being in the realm that compels” is an explanation of freedom which is “not connected to the will,” since it seems to me that the acts of the will being “free” or “not free” are determined by the presence or absence of external compelling. I believe this ultimately comes from a misunderstanding of what is in my translation rendered as \"destining.\"\n\nThe “destining of revealing” is an important technical term for H in this paper.  To “consider” or think about the essence of technology, as H does in this essay, is to experience _Gestell_ or the essence of technology as the “destining of revealing.” “Destining” is the “way of revealing” from which the “essence of all history” is determined, history being neither simply activity or recording, but activity becoming history “as something destined.”  The “destining” of “revealing” then, in these senses, seems to represent in plain terms something like the “making into a tool that thing by which we understand the real truth about the nature of the world,\" since Heidegger says later “The essence of modern technology lies in Enframing.  Enframing belongs within the destining of revealing.\" To “destine,” is to start man on a “way of revealing.”\n\nThis \"destining of revealing,\" or really, way of looking at technology is dangerous: \"Yet when destining reigns in the mode of Enframing, it is the supreme danger. This danger attests itself to us in two ways. As soon as what is unconcealed no longer concerns man even as object, but does so, rather, exclusively as standing-reserve, and man in the midst of objectlessness is nothing but the orderer of the standing-reserve, then he comes to the very brink of a precipitous fall; that is, he comes to the point where he himself will have to be taken as standing-reserve. Meanwhile man, precisely as the one so threatened, exalts himself to the posture of lord of the earth” (16).\n\nFinally Heidegger embraces this danger, making technology into a kind of mystical art, the knowledge of which can shield us from its worst effects.\n\n\"The coming to presence of technology threatens revealing, threatens it with the possibility that all revealing will be consumed in ordering and that every- thing will present itself only in the unconcealedness of standing-reserve. Human activity can never directly counter this danger. Human achievement alone can never banish it. But human reflection can ponder the fact that all saving power must be of a higher essence than what is endangered, though at the same time kindred to it.”  (18) \"The closer we come to the danger, the more brightly do the ways into the saving power begin to shine and the more questioning we become. For questioning is the piety of thought” (19).\n\nThis revelation, this \"coming close to the danger,\" is supposed to take place through art:\n\n\"Once there was a time when the bringing-forth of the true into the beautiful was called _techne_. And the _poiesis_ of the fine arts also was called _techne_. In Greece, at the outset of the destining of the West, the arts soared to the supreme height of the revealing granted them. They brought the presence, \\[_Gegenwart_\\] of the gods, brought the dialogue of divine and human destinings, to radiance. And art was simply called _techne._ It was a single, manifold revealing. It was pious, _promos_, i.e., yielding to the holding-sway and the safekeeping of truth.\n\n\"The arts were not derived from the artistic. Art works were not enjoyed aesthetically. Art was not a sector of cultural activity. What, then, was art – perhaps only for that brief but magnificent time? Why did art bear the modest name _techne_? Because it was a revealing that brought forth and hither, and therefore belonged within _poiesis_. It was finally that revealing which holds complete sway in all the fine arts, in poetry, and in everything poetical that obtained _poiesis_ as its proper name...\n\n\"Could it be that the fine arts are called to poetic revealing? Could it be that revealing lays claim to the arts most primally, so that they for their part may expressly foster the growth of the saving power, may awaken and found anew our look into that which grants and our trust in it?",

    "body": "\"History finds itself stuck between the two poles. Is it a sort of 'objective' knowledge, or is it all really 'subjective'? Or is this a false dichotomy? What sort of knowledge do we have of historical events? On the one hand, historical knowledge is subject to the same caveats as all knowledge in general. It is possible to be mistaken. I may think I am holding a book when it is in fact a lump of wood; I may think Caesar crossed the Rubicon, but it may in fact have been conceivable that someone else got there first. When, therefore, people talk anxiously about whether there is 'real proof' for this or that historical 'event', usually concluding that there is not, the chances are that they are at least dangerously near the edge of the positivist trap, the false either-or of full certainty _versus_ mere unsubstantiated opinion. The evidence for Caesar's crossing the Rubicon is ultimately of the same order as the evidence that what I am holding is a book. Very similar verification procedures, in fact, apply to both propositions. Neither is absolutely certain; neither is so uncertain as to be useless. If we do not recognize this fundamental similarity, we may find ourselves ignoring Cartesian doubt in everyday life and embracing it uncritically for more 'serious' issues. In the New Testament field, some critics have made a great song and dance about the fact that the details of Jesus' life, or the fact of his resurrection, cannot be proved 'scientifically'; philosophical rigor should compel them to admit that the same problem pertains to the vast range of ordinary human knowledge, including the implicit claim that knowledge requires empirical verification. . .\n\n. . . Over and against both of these positions, I propose a form of _critical realism._ This is a way of describing the process of 'knowing' that acknowledges the _reality of the thing known, as something other than the knower_ (hence 'realism'), while also fully acknowledging that the only access we have to this reality lies along the spiraling path of _appropriate dialogue or conversation between the knower and the thing known_ (hence 'critical'). This path leads to critical reflection on the products of our enquiry into 'reality', so that our assertions about 'reality' acknowledge their own provisionality. Knowledge, in other words, although in principle concerning realities independent of the knower, is never itself independent of the knower.\"\n\n\\-- N. T.
